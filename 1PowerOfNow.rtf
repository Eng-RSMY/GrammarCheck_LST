Friends helped by \
placing copies of the book in spiritual bookstores farther \
afield: Calgary, Seattle, California, London. Stephen Gawtry, \
the manager of Watkins, the world's oldest metaphysical \
bookstore in London, England, wrote at the time, "I foresee \
great things for this book." He was right: by the second year \
The Power of Now had developed into an "underground best- \
seller," as one reviewer later called it. Then, after the book \
received a number of favorable reviews in various journals \
and magazines, its growth accelerated and finally became \
explosive when Oprah Winfrey, who had been deeply \
affected by the book, proceeded to tell the world about it. Five \
years after it was first published, it reached #i on the New \
York Times bestseller list, and it is now available in thirty lan- \
guages. It has been very well received and become a best- \
seller even in India, a country considered by many to be the \
birthplace of humanity's quest for spiritual enlightenment. \

THE PRINCE\
\
by Nicolo Machiavelli\
\
Translated by W. K. Marriott\
\
\
Nicolo Machiavelli, born at Florence on 3rd May 1469. From 1494 to 1512\
held an official post at Florence which included diplomatic missions to\
various European courts. Imprisoned in Florence, 1512; later exiled and\
returned to San Casciano. Died at Florence on 22nd June 1527.\

\
INTRODUCTION\
\
Nicolo Machiavelli was born at Florence on 3rd May 1469. He was the\
second son of Bernardo di Nicolo Machiavelli, a lawyer of some repute,\
and of Bartolommea di Stefano Nelli, his wife. Both parents were members\
of the old Florentine nobility.\
\
His life falls naturally into three periods, each of which singularly\
enough constitutes a distinct and important era in the history of\
Florence. His youth was concurrent with the greatness of Florence as an\
Italian power under the guidance of Lorenzo de' Medici, Il Magnifico.\
The downfall of the Medici in Florence occurred in 1494, in which year\
Machiavelli entered the public service. During his official career\
Florence was free under the government of a Republic, which lasted\
until 1512, when the Medici returned to power, and Machiavelli lost his\
office. The Medici again ruled Florence from 1512 until 1527, when they\
were once more driven out. This was the period of Machiavelli's literary\
activity and increasing influence; but he died, within a few weeks of\
the expulsion of the Medici, on 22nd June 1527, in his fifty-eighth\
year, without having regained office.\
\

\
\
YOUTH -- Aet. 1-25--1469-94\
\
Although there is little recorded of the youth of Machiavelli, the\
Florence of those days is so well known that the early environment of\
this representative citizen may be easily imagined. Florence has been\
described as a city with two opposite currents of life, one directed by\
the fervent and austere Savonarola, the other by the splendour-loving\
Lorenzo. Savonarola's influence upon the young Machiavelli must have\
been slight, for although at one time he wielded immense power over the\
fortunes of Florence, he only furnished Machiavelli with a subject of\
a gibe in "The Prince," where he is cited as an example of an unarmed\
prophet who came to a bad end. Whereas the magnificence of the Medicean\
rule during the life of Lorenzo appeared to have impressed Machiavelli\
strongly, for he frequently recurs to it in his writings, and it is to\
Lorenzo's grandson that he dedicates "The Prince."\
\
Machiavelli, in his "History of Florence," gives us a picture of the\
young men among whom his youth was passed. He writes: "They were freer\
than their forefathers in dress and living, and spent more in other\
kinds of excesses, consuming their time and money in idleness, gaming,\
and women; their chief aim was to appear well dressed and to speak with\
wit and acuteness, whilst he who could wound others the most cleverly\
was thought the wisest." In a letter to his son Guido, Machiavelli shows\
why youth should avail itself of its opportunities for study, and leads\
us to infer that his own youth had been so occupied. He writes: "I\
have received your letter, which has given me the greatest pleasure,\
especially because you tell me you are quite restored in health, than\
which I could have no better news; for if God grant life to you, and\
to me, I hope to make a good man of you if you are willing to do your\
share." Then, writing of a new patron, he continues: "This will turn\
out well for you, but it is necessary for you to study; since, then, you\
have no longer the excuse of illness, take pains to study letters and\
music, for you see what honour is done to me for the little skill I\
have. Therefore, my son, if you wish to please me, and to bring success\
and honour to yourself, do right and study, because others will help you\
if you help yourself."\
\

\
OFFICE -- Aet. 25-43--1494-1512\
\
The second period of Machiavelli's life was spent in the service of the\
free Republic of Florence, which flourished, as stated above, from\
the expulsion of the Medici in 1494 until their return in 1512. After\
serving four years in one of the public offices he was appointed\
Chancellor and Secretary to the Second Chancery, the Ten of Liberty\
and Peace. Here we are on firm ground when dealing with the events of\
Machiavelli's life, for during this time he took a leading part in\
the affairs of the Republic, and we have its decrees, records,\
and dispatches to guide us, as well as his own writings. A mere\
recapitulation of a few of his transactions with the statesmen and\
soldiers of his time gives a fair indication of his activities, and\
supplies the sources from which he drew the experiences and characters\
which illustrate "The Prince."\
\
His first mission was in 1499 to Catherina Sforza, "my lady of Forli" of\
"The Prince," from whose conduct and fate he drew the moral that it\
is far better to earn the confidence of the people than to rely on\
fortresses. This is a very noticeable principle in Machiavelli, and is\
urged by him in many ways as a matter of vital importance to princes.\
\
In 1500 he was sent to France to obtain terms from Louis XII for\
continuing the war against Pisa: this king it was who, in his conduct\
of affairs in Italy, committed the five capital errors in statecraft\
summarized in "The Prince," and was consequently driven out. He, also,\
it was who made the dissolution of his marriage a condition of support\
to Pope Alexander VI; which leads Machiavelli to refer those who urge\
that such promises should be kept to what he has written concerning the\
faith of princes.\
\
Machiavelli's public life was largely occupied with events arising out\
of the ambitions of Pope Alexander VI and his son, Cesare Borgia, the\
Duke Valentino, and these characters fill a large space of "The Prince."\
Machiavelli never hesitates to cite the actions of the duke for the\
benefit of usurpers who wish to keep the states they have seized; he\
can, indeed, find no precepts to offer so good as the pattern of Cesare\
Borgia's conduct, insomuch that Cesare is acclaimed by some critics as\
the "hero" of "The Prince." Yet in "The Prince" the duke is in point of\
fact cited as a type of the man who rises on the fortune of others, and\
falls with them; who takes every course that might be expected from a\
prudent man but the course which will save him; who is prepared for all\
eventualities but the one which happens; and who, when all his abilities\
fail to carry him through, exclaims that it was not his fault, but an\
extraordinary and unforeseen fatality.\
\
On the death of Pius III, in 1503, Machiavelli was sent to Rome to watch\
the election of his successor, and there he saw Cesare Borgia cheated\
into allowing the choice of the College to fall on Giuliano delle Rovere\
(Julius II), who was one of the cardinals that had most reason to fear\
the duke. Machiavelli, when commenting on this election, says that\
he who thinks new favours will cause great personages to forget old\
injuries deceives himself. Julius did not rest until he had ruined\
Cesare.\
\
It was to Julius II that Machiavelli was sent in 1506, when that pontiff\
was commencing his enterprise against Bologna; which he brought to a\
successful issue, as he did many of his other adventures, owing chiefly\
to his impetuous character. It is in reference to Pope Julius that\
Machiavelli moralizes on the resemblance between Fortune and women, and\
concludes that it is the bold rather than the cautious man that will win\
and hold them both.\
\
It is impossible to follow here the varying fortunes of the Italian\
states, which in 1507 were controlled by France, Spain, and Germany,\
with results that have lasted to our day; we are concerned with those\
events, and with the three great actors in them, so far only as they\
impinge on the personality of Machiavelli. He had several meetings with\
Louis XII of France, and his estimate of that monarch's character has\
already been alluded to. Machiavelli has painted Ferdinand of Aragon as\
the man who accomplished great things under the cloak of religion, but\
who in reality had no mercy, faith, humanity, or integrity; and who,\
had he allowed himself to be influenced by such motives, would have been\
ruined. The Emperor Maximilian was one of the most interesting men\
of the age, and his character has been drawn by many hands; but\
Machiavelli, who was an envoy at his court in 1507-8, reveals the secret\
of his many failures when he describes him as a secretive man, without\
force of character--ignoring the human agencies necessary to carry\
his schemes into effect, and never insisting on the fulfilment of his\
wishes.\
\
The remaining years of Machiavelli's official career were filled with\
events arising out of the League of Cambrai, made in 1508 between the\
three great European powers already mentioned and the pope, with the\
object of crushing the Venetian Republic. This result was attained in\
the battle of Vaila, when Venice lost in one day all that she had won in\
eight hundred years. Florence had a difficult part to play during these\
events, complicated as they were by the feud which broke out between\
the pope and the French, because friendship with France had dictated the\
entire policy of the Republic. When, in 1511, Julius II finally formed\
the Holy League against France, and with the assistance of the Swiss\
drove the French out of Italy, Florence lay at the mercy of the Pope,\
and had to submit to his terms, one of which was that the Medici should\
be restored. The return of the Medici to Florence on 1st September\
1512, and the consequent fall of the Republic, was the signal for the\
dismissal of Machiavelli and his friends, and thus put an end to his\
public career, for, as we have seen, he died without regaining office.\
\
\
\
\
LITERATURE AND DEATH -- Aet. 43-58--1512-27\
\
On the return of the Medici, Machiavelli, who for a few weeks had\
vainly hoped to retain his office under the new masters of Florence, was\
dismissed by decree dated 7th November 1512. Shortly after this he was\
accused of complicity in an abortive conspiracy against the Medici,\
imprisoned, and put to the question by torture. The new Medicean pope,\
Leo X, procured his release, and he retired to his small property at San\
Casciano, near Florence, where he devoted himself to literature. In a\
letter to Francesco Vettori, dated 13th December 1513, he has left\
a very interesting description of his life at this period, which\
elucidates his methods and his motives in writing "The Prince." After\
describing his daily occupations with his family and neighbours, he\
writes: "The evening being come, I return home and go to my study; at\
the entrance I pull off my peasant-clothes, covered with dust and dirt,\
and put on my noble court dress, and thus becomingly re-clothed I\
pass into the ancient courts of the men of old, where, being lovingly\
received by them, I am fed with that food which is mine alone; where I\
do not hesitate to speak with them, and to ask for the reason of their\
actions, and they in their benignity answer me; and for four hours I\
feel no weariness, I forget every trouble, poverty does not dismay,\
death does not terrify me; I am possessed entirely by those great men.\
And because Dante says:\
\
     Knowledge doth come of learning well retained,\
     Unfruitful else,\
\
I have noted down what I have gained from their conversation, and have\
composed a small work on 'Principalities,' where I pour myself out\
as fully as I can in meditation on the subject, discussing what a\
principality is, what kinds there are, how they can be acquired, how\
they can be kept, why they are lost: and if any of my fancies ever\
pleased you, this ought not to displease you: and to a prince,\
especially to a new one, it should be welcome: therefore I dedicate it\
to his Magnificence Giuliano. Filippo Casavecchio has seen it; he will\
be able to tell you what is in it, and of the discourses I have had with\
him; nevertheless, I am still enriching and polishing it."\
\
The "little book" suffered many vicissitudes before attaining the form\
in which it has reached us. Various mental influences were at work\
during its composition; its title and patron were changed; and for some\
unknown reason it was finally dedicated to Lorenzo de' Medici. Although\
Machiavelli discussed with Casavecchio whether it should be sent or\
presented in person to the patron, there is no evidence that Lorenzo\
ever received or even read it: he certainly never gave Machiavelli any\
employment. Although it was plagiarized during Machiavelli's lifetime,\
"The Prince" was never published by him, and its text is still\
disputable.\
\
Machiavelli concludes his letter to Vettori thus: "And as to this little\
thing [his book], when it has been read it will be seen that during the\
fifteen years I have given to the study of statecraft I have neither\
slept nor idled; and men ought ever to desire to be served by one who\
has reaped experience at the expense of others. And of my loyalty none\
could doubt, because having always kept faith I could not now learn how\
to break it; for he who has been faithful and honest, as I have, cannot\
change his nature; and my poverty is a witness to my honesty."\
\
Before Machiavelli had got "The Prince" off his hands he commenced his\
"Discourse on the First Decade of Titus Livius," which should be read\
concurrently with "The Prince." These and several minor works occupied\
him until the year 1518, when he accepted a small commission to look\
after the affairs of some Florentine merchants at Genoa. In 1519 the\
Medicean rulers of Florence granted a few political concessions to\
her citizens, and Machiavelli with others was consulted upon a new\
constitution under which the Great Council was to be restored; but on\
one pretext or another it was not promulgated.\
\
In 1520 the Florentine merchants again had recourse to Machiavelli\
to settle their difficulties with Lucca, but this year was chiefly\
remarkable for his re-entry into Florentine literary society, where he\
was much sought after, and also for the production of his "Art of War."\
It was in the same year that he received a commission at the instance\
of Cardinal de' Medici to write the "History of Florence," a task\
which occupied him until 1525. His return to popular favour may have\
determined the Medici to give him this employment, for an old writer\
observes that "an able statesman out of work, like a huge whale, will\
endeavour to overturn the ship unless he has an empty cask to play\
with."\
\
When the "History of Florence" was finished, Machiavelli took it to\
Rome for presentation to his patron, Giuliano de' Medici, who had in\
the meanwhile become pope under the title of Clement VII. It is somewhat\
remarkable that, as, in 1513, Machiavelli had written "The Prince" for\
the instruction of the Medici after they had just regained power in\
Florence, so, in 1525, he dedicated the "History of Florence" to the\
head of the family when its ruin was now at hand. In that year the\
battle of Pavia destroyed the French rule in Italy, and left Francis I\
a prisoner in the hands of his great rival, Charles V. This was followed\
by the sack of Rome, upon the news of which the popular party at\
Florence threw off the yoke of the Medici, who were once more banished.\
\
Machiavelli was absent from Florence at this time, but hastened his\
return, hoping to secure his former office of secretary to the "Ten of\
Liberty and Peace." Unhappily he was taken ill soon after he reached\
Florence, where he died on 22nd June 1527.\
\
\
\
\
THE MAN AND HIS WORKS\
\
No one can say where the bones of Machiavelli rest, but modern Florence\
has decreed him a stately cenotaph in Santa Croce, by the side of her\
most famous sons; recognizing that, whatever other nations may have\
found in his works, Italy found in them the idea of her unity and the\
germs of her renaissance among the nations of Europe. Whilst it is idle\
to protest against the world-wide and evil signification of his name,\
it may be pointed out that the harsh construction of his doctrine which\
this sinister reputation implies was unknown to his own day, and that\
the researches of recent times have enabled us to interpret him more\
reasonably. It is due to these inquiries that the shape of an "unholy\
necromancer," which so long haunted men's vision, has begun to fade.\
\
Machiavelli was undoubtedly a man of great observation, acuteness, and\
industry; noting with appreciative eye whatever passed before him, and\
with his supreme literary gift turning it to account in his enforced\
retirement from affairs. He does not present himself, nor is he\
depicted by his contemporaries, as a type of that rare combination,\
the successful statesman and author, for he appears to have been\
only moderately prosperous in his several embassies and political\
employments. He was misled by Catherina Sforza, ignored by Louis XII,\
overawed by Cesare Borgia; several of his embassies were quite barren of\
results; his attempts to fortify Florence failed, and the soldiery that\
he raised astonished everybody by their cowardice. In the conduct of his\
own affairs he was timid and time-serving; he dared not appear by the\
side of Soderini, to whom he owed so much, for fear of compromising\
himself; his connection with the Medici was open to suspicion, and\
Giuliano appears to have recognized his real forte when he set him to\
write the "History of Florence," rather than employ him in the state.\
And it is on the literary side of his character, and there alone, that\
we find no weakness and no failure.\
\
Although the light of almost four centuries has been focused on "The\
Prince," its problems are still debatable and interesting, because they\
are the eternal problems between the ruled and their rulers. Such as\
they are, its ethics are those of Machiavelli's contemporaries; yet they\
cannot be said to be out of date so long as the governments of Europe\
rely on material rather than on moral forces. Its historical incidents\
and personages become interesting by reason of the uses which\
Machiavelli makes of them to illustrate his theories of government and\
conduct.\
\
Leaving out of consideration those maxims of state which still furnish\
some European and eastern statesmen with principles of action, "The\
Prince" is bestrewn with truths that can be proved at every turn. Men\
are still the dupes of their simplicity and greed, as they were in the\
days of Alexander VI. The cloak of religion still conceals the vices\
which Machiavelli laid bare in the character of Ferdinand of Aragon.\
Men will not look at things as they really are, but as they wish them\
to be--and are ruined. In politics there are no perfectly safe courses;\
prudence consists in choosing the least dangerous ones. Then--to pass to\
a higher plane--Machiavelli reiterates that, although crimes may win\
an empire, they do not win glory. Necessary wars are just wars, and\
the arms of a nation are hallowed when it has no other resource but to\
fight.\
\
It is the cry of a far later day than Machiavelli's that government\
should be elevated into a living moral force, capable of inspiring the\
people with a just recognition of the fundamental principles of society;\
to this "high argument" "The Prince" contributes but little. Machiavelli\
always refused to write either of men or of governments otherwise than\
as he found them, and he writes with such skill and insight that his\
work is of abiding value. But what invests "The Prince" with more than\
a merely artistic or historical interest is the incontrovertible truth\
that it deals with the great principles which still guide nations and\
rulers in their relationship with each other and their neighbours.\
\
In translating "The Prince" my aim has been to achieve at all costs an\
exact literal rendering of the original, rather than a fluent paraphrase\
adapted to the modern notions of style and expression. Machiavelli was\
no facile phrasemonger; the conditions under which he wrote obliged him\
to weigh every word; his themes were lofty, his substance grave, his\
manner nobly plain and serious. "Quis eo fuit unquam in partiundis\
rebus, in definiendis, in explanandis pressior?" In "The Prince," it may\
be truly said, there is reason assignable, not only for every word, but\
for the position of every word. To an Englishman of Shakespeare's time\
the translation of such a treatise was in some ways a comparatively easy\
task, for in those times the genius of the English more nearly resembled\
that of the Italian language; to the Englishman of to-day it is not so\
simple. To take a single example: the word "intrattenere," employed by\
Machiavelli to indicate the policy adopted by the Roman Senate towards\
the weaker states of Greece, would by an Elizabethan be correctly\
rendered "entertain," and every contemporary reader would understand\
what was meant by saying that "Rome entertained the Aetolians and the\
Achaeans without augmenting their power." But to-day such a phrase would\
seem obsolete and ambiguous, if not unmeaning: we are compelled to say\
that "Rome maintained friendly relations with the Aetolians," etc.,\
using four words to do the work of one. I have tried to preserve the\
pithy brevity of the Italian so far as was consistent with an absolute\
fidelity to the sense. If the result be an occasional asperity I can\
only hope that the reader, in his eagerness to reach the author's\
meaning, may overlook the roughness of the road that leads him to it.\

\
DEDICATION\
\
     To the Magnificent Lorenzo Di Piero De' Medici:\
\
     Those who strive to obtain the good graces of a prince are\
     accustomed to come before him with such things as they hold most\
     precious, or in which they see him take most delight; whence one\
     often sees horses, arms, cloth of gold, precious stones, and\
     similar ornaments presented to princes, worthy of their greatness.\
\
     Desiring therefore to present myself to your Magnificence with\
     some testimony of my devotion towards you, I have not found among\
     my possessions anything which I hold more dear than, or value so\
     much as, the knowledge of the actions of great men, acquired by\
     long experience in contemporary affairs, and a continual study of\
     antiquity; which, having reflected upon it with great and\
     prolonged diligence, I now send, digested into a little volume, to\
     your Magnificence.\
\
     And although I may consider this work unworthy of your\
     countenance, nevertheless I trust much to your benignity that it\
     may be acceptable, seeing that it is not possible for me to make a\
     better gift than to offer you the opportunity of understanding in\
     the shortest time all that I have learnt in so many years, and\
     with so many troubles and dangers; which work I have not\
     embellished with swelling or magnificent words, nor stuffed with\
     rounded periods, nor with any extrinsic allurements or adornments\
     whatever, with which so many are accustomed to embellish their\
     works; for I have wished either that no honour should be given it,\
     or else that the truth of the matter and the weightiness of the\
     theme shall make it acceptable.\
\
     Nor do I hold with those who regard it as a presumption if a man\
     of low and humble condition dare to discuss and settle the\
     concerns of princes; because, just as those who draw landscapes\
     place themselves below in the plain to contemplate the nature of\
     the mountains and of lofty places, and in order to contemplate the\
     plains place themselves upon high mountains, even so to understand\
     the nature of the people it needs to be a prince, and to\
     understand that of princes it needs to be of the people.\
\
     Take then, your Magnificence, this little gift in the spirit in\
     which I send it; wherein, if it be diligently read and considered\
     by you, you will learn my extreme desire that you should attain\
     that greatness which fortune and your other attributes promise.\
     And if your Magnificence from the summit of your greatness will\
     sometimes turn your eyes to these lower regions, you will see how\
     unmeritedly I suffer a great and continued malignity of fortune.\

THE PRINCE\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER I -- HOW MANY KINDS OF PRINCIPALITIES THERE ARE, AND BY WHAT\
MEANS THEY ARE ACQUIRED\
\
All states, all powers, that have held and hold rule over men have been\
and are either republics or principalities.\
\
Principalities are either hereditary, in which the family has been long\
established; or they are new.\
\
The new are either entirely new, as was Milan to Francesco Sforza, or\
they are, as it were, members annexed to the hereditary state of the\
prince who has acquired them, as was the kingdom of Naples to that of\
the King of Spain.\
\
Such dominions thus acquired are either accustomed to live under a\
prince, or to live in freedom; and are acquired either by the arms of\
the prince himself, or of others, or else by fortune or by ability.\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER II -- CONCERNING HEREDITARY PRINCIPALITIES\
\
I will leave out all discussion on republics, inasmuch as in another\
place I have written of them at length, and will address myself only to\
principalities. In doing so I will keep to the order indicated above,\
and discuss how such principalities are to be ruled and preserved.\
\
I say at once there are fewer difficulties in holding hereditary states,\
and those long accustomed to the family of their prince, than new\
ones; for it is sufficient only not to transgress the customs of his\
ancestors, and to deal prudently with circumstances as they arise, for a\
prince of average powers to maintain himself in his state, unless he\
be deprived of it by some extraordinary and excessive force; and if he\
should be so deprived of it, whenever anything sinister happens to the\
usurper, he will regain it.\
\
We have in Italy, for example, the Duke of Ferrara, who could not have\
withstood the attacks of the Venetians in '84, nor those of Pope Julius\
in '10, unless he had been long established in his dominions. For the\
hereditary prince has less cause and less necessity to offend; hence it\
happens that he will be more loved; and unless extraordinary vices cause\
him to be hated, it is reasonable to expect that his subjects will be\
naturally well disposed towards him; and in the antiquity and duration\
of his rule the memories and motives that make for change are lost, for\
one change always leaves the toothing for another.\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER III -- CONCERNING MIXED PRINCIPALITIES\
\
But the difficulties occur in a new principality. And firstly, if it be\
not entirely new, but is, as it were, a member of a state which, taken\
collectively, may be called composite, the changes arise chiefly from\
an inherent difficulty which there is in all new principalities; for\
men change their rulers willingly, hoping to better themselves, and this\
hope induces them to take up arms against him who rules: wherein they\
are deceived, because they afterwards find by experience they have\
gone from bad to worse. This follows also on another natural and common\
necessity, which always causes a new prince to burden those who have\
submitted to him with his soldiery and with infinite other hardships\
which he must put upon his new acquisition.\
\
In this way you have enemies in all those whom you have injured in\
seizing that principality, and you are not able to keep those friends\
who put you there because of your not being able to satisfy them in the\
way they expected, and you cannot take strong measures against them,\
feeling bound to them. For, although one may be very strong in armed\
forces, yet in entering a province one has always need of the goodwill\
of the natives.\
\
For these reasons Louis the Twelfth, King of France, quickly occupied\
Milan, and as quickly lost it; and to turn him out the first time it\
only needed Lodovico's own forces; because those who had opened the\
gates to him, finding themselves deceived in their hopes of future\
benefit, would not endure the ill-treatment of the new prince. It is\
very true that, after acquiring rebellious provinces a second time,\
they are not so lightly lost afterwards, because the prince, with\
little reluctance, takes the opportunity of the rebellion to punish the\
delinquents, to clear out the suspects, and to strengthen himself in the\
weakest places. Thus to cause France to lose Milan the first time it was\
enough for the Duke Lodovico(*) to raise insurrections on the borders;\
but to cause him to lose it a second time it was necessary to bring\
the whole world against him, and that his armies should be defeated and\
driven out of Italy; which followed from the causes above mentioned.\
\
     (*) Duke Lodovico was Lodovico Moro, a son of Francesco\
     Sforza, who married Beatrice d'Este. He ruled over Milan\
     from 1494 to 1500, and died in 1510.\
\
Nevertheless Milan was taken from France both the first and the second\
time. The general reasons for the first have been discussed; it remains\
to name those for the second, and to see what resources he had, and what\
any one in his situation would have had for maintaining himself more\
securely in his acquisition than did the King of France.\
\
Now I say that those dominions which, when acquired, are added to an\
ancient state by him who acquires them, are either of the same country\
and language, or they are not. When they are, it is easier to hold them,\
especially when they have not been accustomed to self-government; and\
to hold them securely it is enough to have destroyed the family of the\
prince who was ruling them; because the two peoples, preserving in other\
things the old conditions, and not being unlike in customs, will live\
quietly together, as one has seen in Brittany, Burgundy, Gascony, and\
Normandy, which have been bound to France for so long a time: and,\
although there may be some difference in language, nevertheless the\
customs are alike, and the people will easily be able to get on amongst\
themselves. He who has annexed them, if he wishes to hold them, has only\
to bear in mind two considerations: the one, that the family of their\
former lord is extinguished; the other, that neither their laws nor\
their taxes are altered, so that in a very short time they will become\
entirely one body with the old principality.\
\
But when states are acquired in a country differing in language,\
customs, or laws, there are difficulties, and good fortune and great\
energy are needed to hold them, and one of the greatest and most real\
helps would be that he who has acquired them should go and reside there.\
This would make his position more secure and durable, as it has made\
that of the Turk in Greece, who, notwithstanding all the other measures\
taken by him for holding that state, if he had not settled there, would\
not have been able to keep it. Because, if one is on the spot, disorders\
are seen as they spring up, and one can quickly remedy them; but if one\
is not at hand, they are heard of only when they are great, and then one\
can no longer remedy them. Besides this, the country is not pillaged\
by your officials; the subjects are satisfied by prompt recourse to the\
prince; thus, wishing to be good, they have more cause to love him, and\
wishing to be otherwise, to fear him. He who would attack that state\
from the outside must have the utmost caution; as long as the prince\
resides there it can only be wrested from him with the greatest\
difficulty.\
\
The other and better course is to send colonies to one or two places,\
which may be as keys to that state, for it is necessary either to do\
this or else to keep there a great number of cavalry and infantry. A\
prince does not spend much on colonies, for with little or no expense he\
can send them out and keep them there, and he offends a minority only of\
the citizens from whom he takes lands and houses to give them to the new\
inhabitants; and those whom he offends, remaining poor and scattered,\
are never able to injure him; whilst the rest being uninjured are easily\
kept quiet, and at the same time are anxious not to err for fear it\
should happen to them as it has to those who have been despoiled. In\
conclusion, I say that these colonies are not costly, they are more\
faithful, they injure less, and the injured, as has been said, being\
poor and scattered, cannot hurt. Upon this, one has to remark that men\
ought either to be well treated or crushed, because they can avenge\
themselves of lighter injuries, of more serious ones they cannot;\
therefore the injury that is to be done to a man ought to be of such a\
kind that one does not stand in fear of revenge.\
\
But in maintaining armed men there in place of colonies one spends much\
more, having to consume on the garrison all the income from the\
state, so that the acquisition turns into a loss, and many more are\
exasperated, because the whole state is injured; through the shifting\
of the garrison up and down all become acquainted with hardship, and\
all become hostile, and they are enemies who, whilst beaten on their\
own ground, are yet able to do hurt. For every reason, therefore, such\
guards are as useless as a colony is useful.\
\
Again, the prince who holds a country differing in the above respects\
ought to make himself the head and defender of his less powerful\
neighbours, and to weaken the more powerful amongst them, taking care\
that no foreigner as powerful as himself shall, by any accident, get\
a footing there; for it will always happen that such a one will be\
introduced by those who are discontented, either through excess of\
ambition or through fear, as one has seen already. The Romans were\
brought into Greece by the Aetolians; and in every other country where\
they obtained a footing they were brought in by the inhabitants. And the\
usual course of affairs is that, as soon as a powerful foreigner enters\
a country, all the subject states are drawn to him, moved by the hatred\
which they feel against the ruling power. So that in respect to those\
subject states he has not to take any trouble to gain them over to\
himself, for the whole of them quickly rally to the state which he has\
acquired there. He has only to take care that they do not get hold of\
too much power and too much authority, and then with his own forces, and\
with their goodwill, he can easily keep down the more powerful of them,\
so as to remain entirely master in the country. And he who does not\
properly manage this business will soon lose what he has acquired, and\
whilst he does hold it he will have endless difficulties and troubles.\
\
The Romans, in the countries which they annexed, observed closely these\
measures; they sent colonies and maintained friendly relations with(*)\
the minor powers, without increasing their strength; they kept down the\
greater, and did not allow any strong foreign powers to gain authority.\
Greece appears to me sufficient for an example. The Achaeans and\
Aetolians were kept friendly by them, the kingdom of Macedonia was\
humbled, Antiochus was driven out; yet the merits of the Achaeans and\
Aetolians never secured for them permission to increase their power, nor\
did the persuasions of Philip ever induce the Romans to be his friends\
without first humbling him, nor did the influence of Antiochus make them\
agree that he should retain any lordship over the country. Because the\
Romans did in these instances what all prudent princes ought to do,\
who have to regard not only present troubles, but also future ones, for\
which they must prepare with every energy, because, when foreseen, it is\
easy to remedy them; but if you wait until they approach, the medicine\
is no longer in time because the malady has become incurable; for it\
happens in this, as the physicians say it happens in hectic fever,\
that in the beginning of the malady it is easy to cure but difficult to\
detect, but in the course of time, not having been either detected or\
treated in the beginning, it becomes easy to detect but difficult to\
cure. Thus it happens in affairs of state, for when the evils that arise\
have been foreseen (which it is only given to a wise man to see), they\
can be quickly redressed, but when, through not having been foreseen,\
they have been permitted to grow in a way that every one can see them,\
there is no longer a remedy. Therefore, the Romans, foreseeing troubles,\
dealt with them at once, and, even to avoid a war, would not let them\
come to a head, for they knew that war is not to be avoided, but is only\
to be put off to the advantage of others; moreover they wished to fight\
with Philip and Antiochus in Greece so as not to have to do it in Italy;\
they could have avoided both, but this they did not wish; nor did that\
ever please them which is forever in the mouths of the wise ones of our\
time:--Let us enjoy the benefits of the time--but rather the benefits of\
their own valour and prudence, for time drives everything before it, and\
is able to bring with it good as well as evil, and evil as well as good.\
\
     (*) See remark in the introduction on the word\
     "intrattenere."\
\
But let us turn to France and inquire whether she has done any of the\
things mentioned. I will speak of Louis(*) (and not of Charles)(+) as\
the one whose conduct is the better to be observed, he having held\
possession of Italy for the longest period; and you will see that he\
has done the opposite to those things which ought to be done to retain a\
state composed of divers elements.\
\
     (*) Louis XII, King of France, "The Father of the People,"\
     born 1462, died 1515.\
\
     (+) Charles VIII, King of France, born 1470, died 1498.\
\
King Louis was brought into Italy by the ambition of the Venetians, who\
desired to obtain half the state of Lombardy by his intervention. I\
will not blame the course taken by the king, because, wishing to get a\
foothold in Italy, and having no friends there--seeing rather that every\
door was shut to him owing to the conduct of Charles--he was forced to\
accept those friendships which he could get, and he would have succeeded\
very quickly in his design if in other matters he had not made some\
mistakes. The king, however, having acquired Lombardy, regained at once\
the authority which Charles had lost: Genoa yielded; the Florentines\
became his friends; the Marquess of Mantua, the Duke of Ferrara, the\
Bentivogli, my lady of Forli, the Lords of Faenza, of Pesaro, of\
Rimini, of Camerino, of Piombino, the Lucchese, the Pisans, the\
Sienese--everybody made advances to him to become his friend. Then could\
the Venetians realize the rashness of the course taken by them, which,\
in order that they might secure two towns in Lombardy, had made the king\
master of two-thirds of Italy.\
\
Let any one now consider with what little difficulty the king could have\
maintained his position in Italy had he observed the rules above laid\
down, and kept all his friends secure and protected; for although they\
were numerous they were both weak and timid, some afraid of the Church,\
some of the Venetians, and thus they would always have been forced to\
stand in with him, and by their means he could easily have made himself\
secure against those who remained powerful. But he was no sooner in\
Milan than he did the contrary by assisting Pope Alexander to occupy the\
Romagna. It never occurred to him that by this action he was weakening\
himself, depriving himself of friends and of those who had thrown\
themselves into his lap, whilst he aggrandized the Church by adding much\
temporal power to the spiritual, thus giving it greater authority. And\
having committed this prime error, he was obliged to follow it up, so\
much so that, to put an end to the ambition of Alexander, and to prevent\
his becoming the master of Tuscany, he was himself forced to come into\
Italy.\
\
And as if it were not enough to have aggrandized the Church, and\
deprived himself of friends, he, wishing to have the kingdom of Naples,\
divided it with the King of Spain, and where he was the prime arbiter in\
Italy he takes an associate, so that the ambitious of that country and\
the malcontents of his own should have somewhere to shelter; and whereas\
he could have left in the kingdom his own pensioner as king, he drove\
him out, to put one there who was able to drive him, Louis, out in turn.\
\
The wish to acquire is in truth very natural and common, and men always\
do so when they can, and for this they will be praised not blamed; but\
when they cannot do so, yet wish to do so by any means, then there is\
folly and blame. Therefore, if France could have attacked Naples with\
her own forces she ought to have done so; if she could not, then she\
ought not to have divided it. And if the partition which she made with\
the Venetians in Lombardy was justified by the excuse that by it she got\
a foothold in Italy, this other partition merited blame, for it had not\
the excuse of that necessity.\
\
Therefore Louis made these five errors: he destroyed the minor powers,\
he increased the strength of one of the greater powers in Italy, he\
brought in a foreign power, he did not settle in the country, he did not\
send colonies. Which errors, had he lived, were not enough to injure\
him had he not made a sixth by taking away their dominions from the\
Venetians; because, had he not aggrandized the Church, nor brought Spain\
into Italy, it would have been very reasonable and necessary to humble\
them; but having first taken these steps, he ought never to have\
consented to their ruin, for they, being powerful, would always have\
kept off others from designs on Lombardy, to which the Venetians would\
never have consented except to become masters themselves there; also\
because the others would not wish to take Lombardy from France in order\
to give it to the Venetians, and to run counter to both they would not\
have had the courage.\
\
And if any one should say: "King Louis yielded the Romagna to Alexander\
and the kingdom to Spain to avoid war," I answer for the reasons given\
above that a blunder ought never to be perpetrated to avoid war, because\
it is not to be avoided, but is only deferred to your disadvantage. And\
if another should allege the pledge which the king had given to the\
Pope that he would assist him in the enterprise, in exchange for the\
dissolution of his marriage(*) and for the cap to Rouen,(+) to that I\
reply what I shall write later on concerning the faith of princes, and\
how it ought to be kept.\
\
     (*) Louis XII divorced his wife, Jeanne, daughter of Louis\
     XI, and married in 1499 Anne of Brittany, widow of Charles\
     VIII, in order to retain the Duchy of Brittany for the\
     crown.\
\
     (+) The Archbishop of Rouen. He was Georges d'Amboise,\
     created a cardinal by Alexander VI. Born 1460, died 1510.\
\
Thus King Louis lost Lombardy by not having followed any of the\
conditions observed by those who have taken possession of countries and\
wished to retain them. Nor is there any miracle in this, but much that\
is reasonable and quite natural. And on these matters I spoke at Nantes\
with Rouen, when Valentino, as Cesare Borgia, the son of Pope Alexander,\
was usually called, occupied the Romagna, and on Cardinal Rouen\
observing to me that the Italians did not understand war, I replied\
to him that the French did not understand statecraft, meaning that\
otherwise they would not have allowed the Church to reach such\
greatness. And in fact it has been seen that the greatness of the Church\
and of Spain in Italy has been caused by France, and her ruin may be\
attributed to them. From this a general rule is drawn which never or\
rarely fails: that he who is the cause of another becoming powerful\
is ruined; because that predominancy has been brought about either by\
astuteness or else by force, and both are distrusted by him who has been\
raised to power.\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER IV -- WHY THE KINGDOM OF DARIUS, CONQUERED BY ALEXANDER, DID NOT\
REBEL AGAINST THE SUCCESSORS OF ALEXANDER AT HIS DEATH\
\
Considering the difficulties which men have had to hold to a newly\
acquired state, some might wonder how, seeing that Alexander the\
Great became the master of Asia in a few years, and died whilst it\
was scarcely settled (whence it might appear reasonable that the whole\
empire would have rebelled), nevertheless his successors maintained\
themselves, and had to meet no other difficulty than that which arose\
among themselves from their own ambitions.\
\
I answer that the principalities of which one has record are found to\
be governed in two different ways; either by a prince, with a body\
of servants, who assist him to govern the kingdom as ministers by his\
favour and permission; or by a prince and barons, who hold that dignity\
by antiquity of blood and not by the grace of the prince. Such barons\
have states and their own subjects, who recognize them as lords and hold\
them in natural affection. Those states that are governed by a prince\
and his servants hold their prince in more consideration, because in all\
the country there is no one who is recognized as superior to him, and\
if they yield obedience to another they do it as to a minister and\
official, and they do not bear him any particular affection.\
\
The examples of these two governments in our time are the Turk and the\
King of France. The entire monarchy of the Turk is governed by one lord,\
the others are his servants; and, dividing his kingdom into sanjaks, he\
sends there different administrators, and shifts and changes them as\
he chooses. But the King of France is placed in the midst of an ancient\
body of lords, acknowledged by their own subjects, and beloved by them;\
they have their own prerogatives, nor can the king take these away\
except at his peril. Therefore, he who considers both of these states\
will recognize great difficulties in seizing the state of the Turk,\
but, once it is conquered, great ease in holding it. The causes of the\
difficulties in seizing the kingdom of the Turk are that the usurper\
cannot be called in by the princes of the kingdom, nor can he hope to be\
assisted in his designs by the revolt of those whom the lord has around\
him. This arises from the reasons given above; for his ministers, being\
all slaves and bondmen, can only be corrupted with great difficulty, and\
one can expect little advantage from them when they have been corrupted,\
as they cannot carry the people with them, for the reasons assigned.\
Hence, he who attacks the Turk must bear in mind that he will find him\
united, and he will have to rely more on his own strength than on the\
revolt of others; but, if once the Turk has been conquered, and routed\
in the field in such a way that he cannot replace his armies, there\
is nothing to fear but the family of this prince, and, this being\
exterminated, there remains no one to fear, the others having no credit\
with the people; and as the conqueror did not rely on them before his\
victory, so he ought not to fear them after it.\
\
The contrary happens in kingdoms governed like that of France, because\
one can easily enter there by gaining over some baron of the kingdom,\
for one always finds malcontents and such as desire a change. Such men,\
for the reasons given, can open the way into the state and render the\
victory easy; but if you wish to hold it afterwards, you meet with\
infinite difficulties, both from those who have assisted you and from\
those you have crushed. Nor is it enough for you to have exterminated\
the family of the prince, because the lords that remain make themselves\
the heads of fresh movements against you, and as you are unable either\
to satisfy or exterminate them, that state is lost whenever time brings\
the opportunity.\
\
Now if you will consider what was the nature of the government of\
Darius, you will find it similar to the kingdom of the Turk, and\
therefore it was only necessary for Alexander, first to overthrow him in\
the field, and then to take the country from him. After which victory,\
Darius being killed, the state remained secure to Alexander, for the\
above reasons. And if his successors had been united they would have\
enjoyed it securely and at their ease, for there were no tumults raised\
in the kingdom except those they provoked themselves.\
\
But it is impossible to hold with such tranquillity states constituted\
like that of France. Hence arose those frequent rebellions against the\
Romans in Spain, France, and Greece, owing to the many principalities\
there were in these states, of which, as long as the memory of them\
endured, the Romans always held an insecure possession; but with the\
power and long continuance of the empire the memory of them passed\
away, and the Romans then became secure possessors. And when fighting\
afterwards amongst themselves, each one was able to attach to himself\
his own parts of the country, according to the authority he had assumed\
there; and the family of the former lord being exterminated, none other\
than the Romans were acknowledged.\
\
When these things are remembered no one will marvel at the ease with\
which Alexander held the Empire of Asia, or at the difficulties which\
others have had to keep an acquisition, such as Pyrrhus and many more;\
this is not occasioned by the little or abundance of ability in the\
conqueror, but by the want of uniformity in the subject state.\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER V -- CONCERNING THE WAY TO GOVERN CITIES OR PRINCIPALITIES WHICH\
LIVED UNDER THEIR OWN LAWS BEFORE THEY WERE ANNEXED\
\
Whenever those states which have been acquired as stated have been\
accustomed to live under their own laws and in freedom, there are three\
courses for those who wish to hold them: the first is to ruin them, the\
next is to reside there in person, the third is to permit them to live\
under their own laws, drawing a tribute, and establishing within it an\
oligarchy which will keep it friendly to you. Because such a government,\
being created by the prince, knows that it cannot stand without\
his friendship and interest, and does it utmost to support him; and\
therefore he who would keep a city accustomed to freedom will hold it\
more easily by the means of its own citizens than in any other way.\
\
There are, for example, the Spartans and the Romans. The Spartans held\
Athens and Thebes, establishing there an oligarchy; nevertheless they\
lost them. The Romans, in order to hold Capua, Carthage, and Numantia,\
dismantled them, and did not lose them. They wished to hold Greece as\
the Spartans held it, making it free and permitting its laws, and did\
not succeed. So to hold it they were compelled to dismantle many\
cities in the country, for in truth there is no safe way to retain them\
otherwise than by ruining them. And he who becomes master of a city\
accustomed to freedom and does not destroy it, may expect to be\
destroyed by it, for in rebellion it has always the watchword of liberty\
and its ancient privileges as a rallying point, which neither time\
nor benefits will ever cause it to forget. And whatever you may do or\
provide against, they never forget that name or their privileges unless\
they are disunited or dispersed, but at every chance they immediately\
rally to them, as Pisa after the hundred years she had been held in\
bondage by the Florentines.\
\
But when cities or countries are accustomed to live under a prince, and\
his family is exterminated, they, being on the one hand accustomed to\
obey and on the other hand not having the old prince, cannot agree in\
making one from amongst themselves, and they do not know how to govern\
themselves. For this reason they are very slow to take up arms, and a\
prince can gain them to himself and secure them much more easily. But\
in republics there is more vitality, greater hatred, and more desire\
for vengeance, which will never permit them to allow the memory of their\
former liberty to rest; so that the safest way is to destroy them or to\
reside there.\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER VI -- CONCERNING NEW PRINCIPALITIES WHICH ARE ACQUIRED BY ONE'S\
OWN ARMS AND ABILITY\
\
Let no one be surprised if, in speaking of entirely new principalities\
as I shall do, I adduce the highest examples both of prince and of\
state; because men, walking almost always in paths beaten by others, and\
following by imitation their deeds, are yet unable to keep entirely to\
the ways of others or attain to the power of those they imitate. A wise\
man ought always to follow the paths beaten by great men, and to imitate\
those who have been supreme, so that if his ability does not equal\
theirs, at least it will savour of it. Let him act like the clever\
archers who, designing to hit the mark which yet appears too far\
distant, and knowing the limits to which the strength of their bow\
attains, take aim much higher than the mark, not to reach by their\
strength or arrow to so great a height, but to be able with the aid of\
so high an aim to hit the mark they wish to reach.\
\
I say, therefore, that in entirely new principalities, where there is\
a new prince, more or less difficulty is found in keeping them,\
accordingly as there is more or less ability in him who has acquired\
the state. Now, as the fact of becoming a prince from a private station\
presupposes either ability or fortune, it is clear that one or other\
of these things will mitigate in some degree many difficulties.\
Nevertheless, he who has relied least on fortune is established the\
strongest. Further, it facilitates matters when the prince, having no\
other state, is compelled to reside there in person.\
\
But to come to those who, by their own ability and not through fortune,\
have risen to be princes, I say that Moses, Cyrus, Romulus, Theseus,\
and such like are the most excellent examples. And although one may not\
discuss Moses, he having been a mere executor of the will of God, yet\
he ought to be admired, if only for that favour which made him worthy to\
speak with God. But in considering Cyrus and others who have acquired or\
founded kingdoms, all will be found admirable; and if their particular\
deeds and conduct shall be considered, they will not be found inferior\
to those of Moses, although he had so great a preceptor. And in\
examining their actions and lives one cannot see that they owed anything\
to fortune beyond opportunity, which brought them the material to mould\
into the form which seemed best to them. Without that opportunity their\
powers of mind would have been extinguished, and without those powers\
the opportunity would have come in vain.\
\
It was necessary, therefore, to Moses that he should find the people of\
Israel in Egypt enslaved and oppressed by the Egyptians, in order that\
they should be disposed to follow him so as to be delivered out of\
bondage. It was necessary that Romulus should not remain in Alba, and\
that he should be abandoned at his birth, in order that he should become\
King of Rome and founder of the fatherland. It was necessary that Cyrus\
should find the Persians discontented with the government of the Medes,\
and the Medes soft and effeminate through their long peace. Theseus\
could not have shown his ability had he not found the Athenians\
dispersed. These opportunities, therefore, made those men fortunate,\
and their high ability enabled them to recognize the opportunity whereby\
their country was ennobled and made famous.\
\
Those who by valorous ways become princes, like these men, acquire\
a principality with difficulty, but they keep it with ease. The\
difficulties they have in acquiring it rise in part from the new rules\
and methods which they are forced to introduce to establish their\
government and its security. And it ought to be remembered that there\
is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or\
more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction\
of a new order of things, because the innovator has for enemies\
all those who have done well under the old conditions, and lukewarm\
defenders in those who may do well under the new. This coolness arises\
partly from fear of the opponents, who have the laws on their side, and\
partly from the incredulity of men, who do not readily believe in new\
things until they have had a long experience of them. Thus it happens\
that whenever those who are hostile have the opportunity to attack they\
do it like partisans, whilst the others defend lukewarmly, in such wise\
that the prince is endangered along with them.\
\
It is necessary, therefore, if we desire to discuss this matter\
thoroughly, to inquire whether these innovators can rely on themselves\
or have to depend on others: that is to say, whether, to consummate\
their enterprise, have they to use prayers or can they use force? In the\
first instance they always succeed badly, and never compass anything;\
but when they can rely on themselves and use force, then they are rarely\
endangered. Hence it is that all armed prophets have conquered, and the\
unarmed ones have been destroyed. Besides the reasons mentioned, the\
nature of the people is variable, and whilst it is easy to persuade\
them, it is difficult to fix them in that persuasion. And thus it is\
necessary to take such measures that, when they believe no longer, it\
may be possible to make them believe by force.\
\
If Moses, Cyrus, Theseus, and Romulus had been unarmed they could not\
have enforced their constitutions for long--as happened in our time to\
Fra Girolamo Savonarola, who was ruined with his new order of things\
immediately the multitude believed in him no longer, and he had no means\
of keeping steadfast those who believed or of making the unbelievers to\
believe. Therefore such as these have great difficulties in consummating\
their enterprise, for all their dangers are in the ascent, yet with\
ability they will overcome them; but when these are overcome, and those\
who envied them their success are exterminated, they will begin to be\
respected, and they will continue afterwards powerful, secure, honoured,\
and happy.\
\
To these great examples I wish to add a lesser one; still it bears some\
resemblance to them, and I wish it to suffice me for all of a like kind:\
it is Hiero the Syracusan.(*) This man rose from a private station to\
be Prince of Syracuse, nor did he, either, owe anything to fortune but\
opportunity; for the Syracusans, being oppressed, chose him for their\
captain, afterwards he was rewarded by being made their prince. He was\
of so great ability, even as a private citizen, that one who writes\
of him says he wanted nothing but a kingdom to be a king. This man\
abolished the old soldiery, organized the new, gave up old alliances,\
made new ones; and as he had his own soldiers and allies, on such\
foundations he was able to build any edifice: thus, whilst he had\
endured much trouble in acquiring, he had but little in keeping.\

CHAPTER VII -- CONCERNING NEW PRINCIPALITIES WHICH ARE ACQUIRED EITHER\
BY THE ARMS OF OTHERS OR BY GOOD FORTUNE\
\
Those who solely by good fortune become princes from being private\
citizens have little trouble in rising, but much in keeping atop; they\
have not any difficulties on the way up, because they fly, but they have\
many when they reach the summit. Such are those to whom some state\
is given either for money or by the favour of him who bestows it;\
as happened to many in Greece, in the cities of Ionia and of the\
Hellespont, where princes were made by Darius, in order that they might\
hold the cities both for his security and his glory; as also were those\
emperors who, by the corruption of the soldiers, from being citizens\
came to empire. Such stand simply elevated upon the goodwill and the\
fortune of him who has elevated them--two most inconstant and unstable\
things. Neither have they the knowledge requisite for the position;\
because, unless they are men of great worth and ability, it is not\
reasonable to expect that they should know how to command, having always\
lived in a private condition; besides, they cannot hold it because they\
have not forces which they can keep friendly and faithful.\
\
States that rise unexpectedly, then, like all other things in nature\
which are born and grow rapidly, cannot leave their foundations and\
correspondencies(*) fixed in such a way that the first storm will\
not overthrow them; unless, as is said, those who unexpectedly become\
princes are men of so much ability that they know they have to be\
prepared at once to hold that which fortune has thrown into their laps,\
and that those foundations, which others have laid BEFORE they became\
princes, they must lay AFTERWARDS.\
\
     (*) "Le radici e corrispondenze," their roots (i.e.\
     foundations) and correspondencies or relations with other\
     states--a common meaning of "correspondence" and\
     "correspondency" in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.\
\
Concerning these two methods of rising to be a prince by ability or\
fortune, I wish to adduce two examples within our own recollection, and\
these are Francesco Sforza(*) and Cesare Borgia. Francesco, by proper\
means and with great ability, from being a private person rose to be\
Duke of Milan, and that which he had acquired with a thousand anxieties\
he kept with little trouble. On the other hand, Cesare Borgia, called by\
the people Duke Valentino, acquired his state during the ascendancy of\
his father, and on its decline he lost it, notwithstanding that he had\
taken every measure and done all that ought to be done by a wise and\
able man to fix firmly his roots in the states which the arms and\
fortunes of others had bestowed on him.\
\
     (*) Francesco Sforza, born 1401, died 1466. He married\
     Bianca Maria Visconti, a natural daughter of Filippo\
     Visconti, the Duke of Milan, on whose death he procured his\
     own elevation to the duchy. Machiavelli was the accredited\
     agent of the Florentine Republic to Cesare Borgia (1478-\
     1507) during the transactions which led up to the\
     assassinations of the Orsini and Vitelli at Sinigalia, and\
     along with his letters to his chiefs in Florence he has left\
     an account, written ten years before "The Prince," of the\
     proceedings of the duke in his "Descritione del modo tenuto\
     dal duca Valentino nello ammazzare Vitellozzo Vitelli,"\
     etc., a translation of which is appended to the present\
     work.\
\
Because, as is stated above, he who has not first laid his foundations\
may be able with great ability to lay them afterwards, but they will\
be laid with trouble to the architect and danger to the building. If,\
therefore, all the steps taken by the duke be considered, it will be\
seen that he laid solid foundations for his future power, and I do not\
consider it superfluous to discuss them, because I do not know what\
better precepts to give a new prince than the example of his actions;\
and if his dispositions were of no avail, that was not his fault, but\
the extraordinary and extreme malignity of fortune.\
\
Alexander the Sixth, in wishing to aggrandize the duke, his son, had\
many immediate and prospective difficulties. Firstly, he did not see his\
way to make him master of any state that was not a state of the Church;\
and if he was willing to rob the Church he knew that the Duke of Milan\
and the Venetians would not consent, because Faenza and Rimini were\
already under the protection of the Venetians. Besides this, he saw the\
arms of Italy, especially those by which he might have been assisted, in\
hands that would fear the aggrandizement of the Pope, namely, the Orsini\
and the Colonnesi and their following. It behoved him, therefore,\
to upset this state of affairs and embroil the powers, so as to make\
himself securely master of part of their states. This was easy for him\
to do, because he found the Venetians, moved by other reasons, inclined\
to bring back the French into Italy; he would not only not oppose this,\
but he would render it more easy by dissolving the former marriage of\
King Louis. Therefore the king came into Italy with the assistance of\
the Venetians and the consent of Alexander. He was no sooner in Milan\
than the Pope had soldiers from him for the attempt on the Romagna,\
which yielded to him on the reputation of the king. The duke, therefore,\
having acquired the Romagna and beaten the Colonnesi, while wishing to\
hold that and to advance further, was hindered by two things: the one,\
his forces did not appear loyal to him, the other, the goodwill of\
France: that is to say, he feared that the forces of the Orsini, which\
he was using, would not stand to him, that not only might they hinder\
him from winning more, but might themselves seize what he had won, and\
that the king might also do the same. Of the Orsini he had a warning\
when, after taking Faenza and attacking Bologna, he saw them go very\
unwillingly to that attack. And as to the king, he learned his mind when\
he himself, after taking the Duchy of Urbino, attacked Tuscany, and the\
king made him desist from that undertaking; hence the duke decided to\
depend no more upon the arms and the luck of others.\
\
For the first thing he weakened the Orsini and Colonnesi parties in\
Rome, by gaining to himself all their adherents who were gentlemen,\
making them his gentlemen, giving them good pay, and, according to their\
rank, honouring them with office and command in such a way that in a few\
months all attachment to the factions was destroyed and turned entirely\
to the duke. After this he awaited an opportunity to crush the Orsini,\
having scattered the adherents of the Colonna house. This came to him\
soon and he used it well; for the Orsini, perceiving at length that the\
aggrandizement of the duke and the Church was ruin to them, called a\
meeting of the Magione in Perugia. From this sprung the rebellion at\
Urbino and the tumults in the Romagna, with endless dangers to the duke,\
all of which he overcame with the help of the French. Having restored\
his authority, not to leave it at risk by trusting either to the French\
or other outside forces, he had recourse to his wiles, and he knew\
so well how to conceal his mind that, by the mediation of Signor\
Pagolo--whom the duke did not fail to secure with all kinds of\
attention, giving him money, apparel, and horses--the Orsini were\
reconciled, so that their simplicity brought them into his power\
at Sinigalia.(*) Having exterminated the leaders, and turned their\
partisans into his friends, the duke laid sufficiently good foundations\
to his power, having all the Romagna and the Duchy of Urbino; and the\
people now beginning to appreciate their prosperity, he gained them\
all over to himself. And as this point is worthy of notice, and to be\
imitated by others, I am not willing to leave it out.\
\
     (*) Sinigalia, 31st December 1502.\
\
When the duke occupied the Romagna he found it under the rule of weak\
masters, who rather plundered their subjects than ruled them, and gave\
them more cause for disunion than for union, so that the country was\
full of robbery, quarrels, and every kind of violence; and so, wishing\
to bring back peace and obedience to authority, he considered it\
necessary to give it a good governor. Thereupon he promoted Messer\
Ramiro d'Orco,(*) a swift and cruel man, to whom he gave the fullest\
power. This man in a short time restored peace and unity with the\
greatest success. Afterwards the duke considered that it was not\
advisable to confer such excessive authority, for he had no doubt but\
that he would become odious, so he set up a court of judgment in the\
country, under a most excellent president, wherein all cities had their\
advocates. And because he knew that the past severity had caused some\
hatred against himself, so, to clear himself in the minds of the people,\
and gain them entirely to himself, he desired to show that, if any\
cruelty had been practised, it had not originated with him, but in the\
natural sternness of the minister. Under this pretence he took Ramiro,\
and one morning caused him to be executed and left on the piazza at\
Cesena with the block and a bloody knife at his side. The barbarity of\
this spectacle caused the people to be at once satisfied and dismayed.\
\
     (*) Ramiro d'Orco. Ramiro de Lorqua.\
\
But let us return whence we started. I say that the duke, finding\
himself now sufficiently powerful and partly secured from immediate\
dangers by having armed himself in his own way, and having in a great\
measure crushed those forces in his vicinity that could injure him if he\
wished to proceed with his conquest, had next to consider France, for\
he knew that the king, who too late was aware of his mistake, would not\
support him. And from this time he began to seek new alliances and to\
temporize with France in the expedition which she was making towards the\
kingdom of Naples against the Spaniards who were besieging Gaeta. It\
was his intention to secure himself against them, and this he would have\
quickly accomplished had Alexander lived.\
\
Such was his line of action as to present affairs. But as to the future\
he had to fear, in the first place, that a new successor to the Church\
might not be friendly to him and might seek to take from him that which\
Alexander had given him, so he decided to act in four ways. Firstly, by\
exterminating the families of those lords whom he had despoiled, so as\
to take away that pretext from the Pope. Secondly, by winning to himself\
all the gentlemen of Rome, so as to be able to curb the Pope with their\
aid, as has been observed. Thirdly, by converting the college more to\
himself. Fourthly, by acquiring so much power before the Pope should die\
that he could by his own measures resist the first shock. Of these four\
things, at the death of Alexander, he had accomplished three. For he had\
killed as many of the dispossessed lords as he could lay hands on, and\
few had escaped; he had won over the Roman gentlemen, and he had the\
most numerous party in the college. And as to any fresh acquisition, he\
intended to become master of Tuscany, for he already possessed Perugia\
and Piombino, and Pisa was under his protection. And as he had no longer\
to study France (for the French were already driven out of the kingdom\
of Naples by the Spaniards, and in this way both were compelled to buy\
his goodwill), he pounced down upon Pisa. After this, Lucca and Siena\
yielded at once, partly through hatred and partly through fear of\
the Florentines; and the Florentines would have had no remedy had he\
continued to prosper, as he was prospering the year that Alexander died,\
for he had acquired so much power and reputation that he would have\
stood by himself, and no longer have depended on the luck and the forces\
of others, but solely on his own power and ability.\
\
But Alexander died five years after he had first drawn the sword. He\
left the duke with the state of Romagna alone consolidated, with the\
rest in the air, between two most powerful hostile armies, and sick unto\
death. Yet there were in the duke such boldness and ability, and he knew\
so well how men are to be won or lost, and so firm were the foundations\
which in so short a time he had laid, that if he had not had those\
armies on his back, or if he had been in good health, he would have\
overcome all difficulties. And it is seen that his foundations were\
good, for the Romagna awaited him for more than a month. In Rome,\
although but half alive, he remained secure; and whilst the Baglioni,\
the Vitelli, and the Orsini might come to Rome, they could not effect\
anything against him. If he could not have made Pope him whom he wished,\
at least the one whom he did not wish would not have been elected. But\
if he had been in sound health at the death of Alexander,(*) everything\
would have been different to him. On the day that Julius the Second(+)\
was elected, he told me that he had thought of everything that might\
occur at the death of his father, and had provided a remedy for all,\
except that he had never anticipated that, when the death did happen, he\
himself would be on the point to die.\
\
     (*) Alexander VI died of fever, 18th August 1503.\
\
     (+) Julius II was Giuliano della Rovere, Cardinal of San\
     Pietro ad Vincula, born 1443, died 1513.\
\
When all the actions of the duke are recalled, I do not know how to\
blame him, but rather it appears to be, as I have said, that I ought to\
offer him for imitation to all those who, by the fortune or the arms of\
others, are raised to government. Because he, having a lofty spirit and\
far-reaching aims, could not have regulated his conduct otherwise,\
and only the shortness of the life of Alexander and his own sickness\
frustrated his designs. Therefore, he who considers it necessary to\
secure himself in his new principality, to win friends, to overcome\
either by force or fraud, to make himself beloved and feared by the\
people, to be followed and revered by the soldiers, to exterminate those\
who have power or reason to hurt him, to change the old order of things\
for new, to be severe and gracious, magnanimous and liberal, to destroy\
a disloyal soldiery and to create new, to maintain friendship with kings\
and princes in such a way that they must help him with zeal and offend\
with caution, cannot find a more lively example than the actions of this\
man.\
\
Only can he be blamed for the election of Julius the Second, in whom he\
made a bad choice, because, as is said, not being able to elect a Pope\
to his own mind, he could have hindered any other from being elected\
Pope; and he ought never to have consented to the election of any\
cardinal whom he had injured or who had cause to fear him if they became\
pontiffs. For men injure either from fear or hatred. Those whom he\
had injured, amongst others, were San Pietro ad Vincula, Colonna, San\
Giorgio, and Ascanio.(*) The rest, in becoming Pope, had to fear him,\
Rouen and the Spaniards excepted; the latter from their relationship and\
obligations, the former from his influence, the kingdom of France having\
relations with him. Therefore, above everything, the duke ought to have\
created a Spaniard Pope, and, failing him, he ought to have consented to\
Rouen and not San Pietro ad Vincula. He who believes that new benefits\
will cause great personages to forget old injuries is deceived.\
Therefore, the duke erred in his choice, and it was the cause of his\
ultimate ruin.\

     Sforza.\

\
CHAPTER VIII -- CONCERNING THOSE WHO HAVE OBTAINED A PRINCIPALITY BY\
WICKEDNESS\
\
Although a prince may rise from a private station in two ways, neither\
of which can be entirely attributed to fortune or genius, yet it is\
manifest to me that I must not be silent on them, although one could be\
more copiously treated when I discuss republics. These methods are\
when, either by some wicked or nefarious ways, one ascends to the\
principality, or when by the favour of his fellow-citizens a private\
person becomes the prince of his country. And speaking of the first\
method, it will be illustrated by two examples--one ancient, the other\
modern--and without entering further into the subject, I consider these\
two examples will suffice those who may be compelled to follow them.\
\
Agathocles, the Sicilian,(*) became King of Syracuse not only from\
a private but from a low and abject position. This man, the son of a\
potter, through all the changes in his fortunes always led an infamous\
life. Nevertheless, he accompanied his infamies with so much ability of\
mind and body that, having devoted himself to the military profession,\
he rose through its ranks to be Praetor of Syracuse. Being established\
in that position, and having deliberately resolved to make himself\
prince and to seize by violence, without obligation to others, that\
which had been conceded to him by assent, he came to an understanding\
for this purpose with Amilcar, the Carthaginian, who, with his army, was\
fighting in Sicily. One morning he assembled the people and the senate\
of Syracuse, as if he had to discuss with them things relating to the\
Republic, and at a given signal the soldiers killed all the senators and\
the richest of the people; these dead, he seized and held the princedom\
of that city without any civil commotion. And although he was twice\
routed by the Carthaginians, and ultimately besieged, yet not only was\
he able to defend his city, but leaving part of his men for its defence,\
with the others he attacked Africa, and in a short time raised the\
siege of Syracuse. The Carthaginians, reduced to extreme necessity, were\
compelled to come to terms with Agathocles, and, leaving Sicily to him,\
had to be content with the possession of Africa.\
\
     (*) Agathocles the Sicilian, born 361 B.C., died 289 B.C.\
\
Therefore, he who considers the actions and the genius of this man will\
see nothing, or little, which can be attributed to fortune, inasmuch as\
he attained pre-eminence, as is shown above, not by the favour of any\
one, but step by step in the military profession, which steps were\
gained with a thousand troubles and perils, and were afterwards boldly\
held by him with many hazardous dangers. Yet it cannot be called talent\
to slay fellow-citizens, to deceive friends, to be without faith,\
without mercy, without religion; such methods may gain empire, but\
not glory. Still, if the courage of Agathocles in entering into and\
extricating himself from dangers be considered, together with his\
greatness of mind in enduring and overcoming hardships, it cannot be\
seen why he should be esteemed less than the most notable captain.\
Nevertheless, his barbarous cruelty and inhumanity with infinite\
wickedness do not permit him to be celebrated among the most excellent\
men. What he achieved cannot be attributed either to fortune or genius.\
\
In our times, during the rule of Alexander the Sixth, Oliverotto da\
Fermo, having been left an orphan many years before, was brought up\
by his maternal uncle, Giovanni Fogliani, and in the early days of his\
youth sent to fight under Pagolo Vitelli, that, being trained under\
his discipline, he might attain some high position in the military\
profession. After Pagolo died, he fought under his brother Vitellozzo,\
and in a very short time, being endowed with wit and a vigorous body\
and mind, he became the first man in his profession. But it appearing\
a paltry thing to serve under others, he resolved, with the aid of some\
citizens of Fermo, to whom the slavery of their country was dearer than\
its liberty, and with the help of the Vitelleschi, to seize Fermo. So\
he wrote to Giovanni Fogliani that, having been away from home for many\
years, he wished to visit him and his city, and in some measure to look\
upon his patrimony; and although he had not laboured to acquire anything\
except honour, yet, in order that the citizens should see he had not\
spent his time in vain, he desired to come honourably, so would be\
accompanied by one hundred horsemen, his friends and retainers; and he\
entreated Giovanni to arrange that he should be received honourably by\
the Fermians, all of which would be not only to his honour, but also to\
that of Giovanni himself, who had brought him up.\
\
Giovanni, therefore, did not fail in any attentions due to his nephew,\
and he caused him to be honourably received by the Fermians, and he\
lodged him in his own house, where, having passed some days, and having\
arranged what was necessary for his wicked designs, Oliverotto gave a\
solemn banquet to which he invited Giovanni Fogliani and the chiefs of\
Fermo. When the viands and all the other entertainments that are usual\
in such banquets were finished, Oliverotto artfully began certain grave\
discourses, speaking of the greatness of Pope Alexander and his son\
Cesare, and of their enterprises, to which discourse Giovanni and others\
answered; but he rose at once, saying that such matters ought to be\
discussed in a more private place, and he betook himself to a chamber,\
whither Giovanni and the rest of the citizens went in after him. No\
sooner were they seated than soldiers issued from secret places and\
slaughtered Giovanni and the rest. After these murders Oliverotto,\
mounted on horseback, rode up and down the town and besieged the chief\
magistrate in the palace, so that in fear the people were forced to obey\
him, and to form a government, of which he made himself the prince. He\
killed all the malcontents who were able to injure him, and strengthened\
himself with new civil and military ordinances, in such a way that, in\
the year during which he held the principality, not only was he\
secure in the city of Fermo, but he had become formidable to all his\
neighbours. And his destruction would have been as difficult as that\
of Agathocles if he had not allowed himself to be overreached by Cesare\
Borgia, who took him with the Orsini and Vitelli at Sinigalia, as was\
stated above. Thus one year after he had committed this parricide, he\
was strangled, together with Vitellozzo, whom he had made his leader in\
valour and wickedness.\
\
Some may wonder how it can happen that Agathocles, and his like, after\
infinite treacheries and cruelties, should live for long secure in\
his country, and defend himself from external enemies, and never be\
conspired against by his own citizens; seeing that many others, by means\
of cruelty, have never been able even in peaceful times to hold the\
state, still less in the doubtful times of war. I believe that this\
follows from severities(*) being badly or properly used. Those may be\
called properly used, if of evil it is possible to speak well, that are\
applied at one blow and are necessary to one's security, and that are\
not persisted in afterwards unless they can be turned to the advantage\
of the subjects. The badly employed are those which, notwithstanding\
they may be few in the commencement, multiply with time rather than\
decrease. Those who practise the first system are able, by aid of God\
or man, to mitigate in some degree their rule, as Agathocles did. It is\
impossible for those who follow the other to maintain themselves.\
\
     (*) Mr Burd suggests that this word probably comes near the\
     modern equivalent of Machiavelli's thought when he speaks of\
     "crudelta" than the more obvious "cruelties."\
\
Hence it is to be remarked that, in seizing a state, the usurper ought\
to examine closely into all those injuries which it is necessary for him\
to inflict, and to do them all at one stroke so as not to have to repeat\
them daily; and thus by not unsettling men he will be able to reassure\
them, and win them to himself by benefits. He who does otherwise, either\
from timidity or evil advice, is always compelled to keep the knife\
in his hand; neither can he rely on his subjects, nor can they attach\
themselves to him, owing to their continued and repeated wrongs. For\
injuries ought to be done all at one time, so that, being tasted less,\
they offend less; benefits ought to be given little by little, so that\
the flavour of them may last longer.\
\
And above all things, a prince ought to live amongst his people in such\
a way that no unexpected circumstances, whether of good or evil, shall\
make him change; because if the necessity for this comes in troubled\
times, you are too late for harsh measures; and mild ones will not help\
you, for they will be considered as forced from you, and no one will be\
under any obligation to you for them.\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER IX -- CONCERNING A CIVIL PRINCIPALITY\
\
But coming to the other point--where a leading citizen becomes the\
prince of his country, not by wickedness or any intolerable violence,\
but by the favour of his fellow citizens--this may be called a civil\
principality: nor is genius or fortune altogether necessary to attain to\
it, but rather a happy shrewdness. I say then that such a principality\
is obtained either by the favour of the people or by the favour of the\
nobles. Because in all cities these two distinct parties are found,\
and from this it arises that the people do not wish to be ruled nor\
oppressed by the nobles, and the nobles wish to rule and oppress the\
people; and from these two opposite desires there arises in cities one\
of three results, either a principality, self-government, or anarchy.\
\
A principality is created either by the people or by the nobles,\
accordingly as one or other of them has the opportunity; for the nobles,\
seeing they cannot withstand the people, begin to cry up the reputation\
of one of themselves, and they make him a prince, so that under his\
shadow they can give vent to their ambitions. The people, finding\
they cannot resist the nobles, also cry up the reputation of one of\
themselves, and make him a prince so as to be defended by his authority.\
He who obtains sovereignty by the assistance of the nobles maintains\
himself with more difficulty than he who comes to it by the aid of\
the people, because the former finds himself with many around him who\
consider themselves his equals, and because of this he can neither rule\
nor manage them to his liking. But he who reaches sovereignty by popular\
favour finds himself alone, and has none around him, or few, who are not\
prepared to obey him.\
\
Besides this, one cannot by fair dealing, and without injury to others,\
satisfy the nobles, but you can satisfy the people, for their object is\
more righteous than that of the nobles, the latter wishing to oppress,\
while the former only desire not to be oppressed. It is to be added also\
that a prince can never secure himself against a hostile people, because\
of their being too many, whilst from the nobles he can secure himself,\
as they are few in number. The worst that a prince may expect from a\
hostile people is to be abandoned by them; but from hostile nobles he\
has not only to fear abandonment, but also that they will rise against\
him; for they, being in these affairs more far-seeing and astute, always\
come forward in time to save themselves, and to obtain favours from him\
whom they expect to prevail. Further, the prince is compelled to live\
always with the same people, but he can do well without the same nobles,\
being able to make and unmake them daily, and to give or take away\
authority when it pleases him.\
\
Therefore, to make this point clearer, I say that the nobles ought to\
be looked at mainly in two ways: that is to say, they either shape their\
course in such a way as binds them entirely to your fortune, or they do\
not. Those who so bind themselves, and are not rapacious, ought to be\
honoured and loved; those who do not bind themselves may be dealt\
with in two ways; they may fail to do this through pusillanimity and a\
natural want of courage, in which case you ought to make use of them,\
especially of those who are of good counsel; and thus, whilst in\
prosperity you honour them, in adversity you do not have to fear them.\
But when for their own ambitious ends they shun binding themselves, it\
is a token that they are giving more thought to themselves than to you,\
and a prince ought to guard against such, and to fear them as if they\
were open enemies, because in adversity they always help to ruin him.\
\
Therefore, one who becomes a prince through the favour of the people\
ought to keep them friendly, and this he can easily do seeing they\
only ask not to be oppressed by him. But one who, in opposition to\
the people, becomes a prince by the favour of the nobles, ought, above\
everything, to seek to win the people over to himself, and this he may\
easily do if he takes them under his protection. Because men, when they\
receive good from him of whom they were expecting evil, are bound more\
closely to their benefactor; thus the people quickly become more devoted\
to him than if he had been raised to the principality by their favours;\
and the prince can win their affections in many ways, but as these vary\
according to the circumstances one cannot give fixed rules, so I omit\
them; but, I repeat, it is necessary for a prince to have the people\
friendly, otherwise he has no security in adversity.\
\
Nabis,(*) Prince of the Spartans, sustained the attack of all Greece,\
and of a victorious Roman army, and against them he defended his country\
and his government; and for the overcoming of this peril it was only\
necessary for him to make himself secure against a few, but this would\
not have been sufficient had the people been hostile. And do not let any\
one impugn this statement with the trite proverb that "He who builds on\
the people, builds on the mud," for this is true when a private citizen\
makes a foundation there, and persuades himself that the people will\
free him when he is oppressed by his enemies or by the magistrates;\
wherein he would find himself very often deceived, as happened to the\
Gracchi in Rome and to Messer Giorgio Scali(+) in Florence. But granted\
a prince who has established himself as above, who can command, and is\
a man of courage, undismayed in adversity, who does not fail in other\
qualifications, and who, by his resolution and energy, keeps the whole\
people encouraged--such a one will never find himself deceived in them,\
and it will be shown that he has laid his foundations well.\
\
     (*) Nabis, tyrant of Sparta, conquered by the Romans under\
     Flamininus in 195 B.C.; killed 192 B.C.\
\
     (+) Messer Giorgio Scali. This event is to be found in\
     Machiavelli's "Florentine History," Book III.\
\
These principalities are liable to danger when they are passing from the\
civil to the absolute order of government, for such princes either rule\
personally or through magistrates. In the latter case their government\
is weaker and more insecure, because it rests entirely on the goodwill\
of those citizens who are raised to the magistracy, and who, especially\
in troubled times, can destroy the government with great ease, either\
by intrigue or open defiance; and the prince has not the chance amid\
tumults to exercise absolute authority, because the citizens and\
subjects, accustomed to receive orders from magistrates, are not of\
a mind to obey him amid these confusions, and there will always be in\
doubtful times a scarcity of men whom he can trust. For such a prince\
cannot rely upon what he observes in quiet times, when citizens have\
need of the state, because then every one agrees with him; they all\
promise, and when death is far distant they all wish to die for him;\
but in troubled times, when the state has need of its citizens, then\
he finds but few. And so much the more is this experiment dangerous,\
inasmuch as it can only be tried once. Therefore a wise prince ought to\
adopt such a course that his citizens will always in every sort and\
kind of circumstance have need of the state and of him, and then he will\
always find them faithful.\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER X -- CONCERNING THE WAY IN WHICH THE STRENGTH OF ALL\
PRINCIPALITIES OUGHT TO BE MEASURED\
\
It is necessary to consider another point in examining the character of\
these principalities: that is, whether a prince has such power that, in\
case of need, he can support himself with his own resources, or whether\
he has always need of the assistance of others. And to make this quite\
clear I say that I consider those who are able to support themselves by\
their own resources who can, either by abundance of men or money, raise\
a sufficient army to join battle against any one who comes to attack\
them; and I consider those always to have need of others who cannot\
show themselves against the enemy in the field, but are forced to\
defend themselves by sheltering behind walls. The first case has been\
discussed, but we will speak of it again should it recur. In the second\
case one can say nothing except to encourage such princes to provision\
and fortify their towns, and not on any account to defend the country.\
And whoever shall fortify his town well, and shall have managed the\
other concerns of his subjects in the way stated above, and to be often\
repeated, will never be attacked without great caution, for men are\
always adverse to enterprises where difficulties can be seen, and it\
will be seen not to be an easy thing to attack one who has his town well\
fortified, and is not hated by his people.\
\
The cities of Germany are absolutely free, they own but little country\
around them, and they yield obedience to the emperor when it suits\
them, nor do they fear this or any other power they may have near them,\
because they are fortified in such a way that every one thinks the\
taking of them by assault would be tedious and difficult, seeing they\
have proper ditches and walls, they have sufficient artillery, and they\
always keep in public depots enough for one year's eating, drinking, and\
firing. And beyond this, to keep the people quiet and without loss to\
the state, they always have the means of giving work to the community\
in those labours that are the life and strength of the city, and on\
the pursuit of which the people are supported; they also hold military\
exercises in repute, and moreover have many ordinances to uphold them.\
\
Therefore, a prince who has a strong city, and had not made himself\
odious, will not be attacked, or if any one should attack he will only\
be driven off with disgrace; again, because that the affairs of this\
world are so changeable, it is almost impossible to keep an army a whole\
year in the field without being interfered with. And whoever should\
reply: If the people have property outside the city, and see it burnt,\
they will not remain patient, and the long siege and self-interest will\
make them forget their prince; to this I answer that a powerful and\
courageous prince will overcome all such difficulties by giving at one\
time hope to his subjects that the evil will not be for long, at another\
time fear of the cruelty of the enemy, then preserving himself adroitly\
from those subjects who seem to him to be too bold.\
\
Further, the enemy would naturally on his arrival at once burn and ruin\
the country at the time when the spirits of the people are still hot and\
ready for the defence; and, therefore, so much the less ought the prince\
to hesitate; because after a time, when spirits have cooled, the damage\
is already done, the ills are incurred, and there is no longer any\
remedy; and therefore they are so much the more ready to unite with\
their prince, he appearing to be under obligations to them now that\
their houses have been burnt and their possessions ruined in his\
defence. For it is the nature of men to be bound by the benefits they\
confer as much as by those they receive. Therefore, if everything is\
well considered, it will not be difficult for a wise prince to keep the\
minds of his citizens steadfast from first to last, when he does not\
fail to support and defend them.\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XI -- CONCERNING ECCLESIASTICAL PRINCIPALITIES\
\
It only remains now to speak of ecclesiastical principalities, touching\
which all difficulties are prior to getting possession, because they\
are acquired either by capacity or good fortune, and they can be held\
without either; for they are sustained by the ancient ordinances of\
religion, which are so all-powerful, and of such a character that the\
principalities may be held no matter how their princes behave and live.\
These princes alone have states and do not defend them; and they have\
subjects and do not rule them; and the states, although unguarded, are\
not taken from them, and the subjects, although not ruled, do not care,\
and they have neither the desire nor the ability to alienate themselves.\
Such principalities only are secure and happy. But being upheld by\
powers, to which the human mind cannot reach, I shall speak no more of\
them, because, being exalted and maintained by God, it would be the act\
of a presumptuous and rash man to discuss them.\
\
Nevertheless, if any one should ask of me how comes it that the\
Church has attained such greatness in temporal power, seeing that from\
Alexander backwards the Italian potentates (not only those who have been\
called potentates, but every baron and lord, though the smallest)\
have valued the temporal power very slightly--yet now a king of France\
trembles before it, and it has been able to drive him from Italy, and\
to ruin the Venetians--although this may be very manifest, it does not\
appear to me superfluous to recall it in some measure to memory.\
\
Before Charles, King of France, passed into Italy,(*) this country was\
under the dominion of the Pope, the Venetians, the King of Naples, the\
Duke of Milan, and the Florentines. These potentates had two principal\
anxieties: the one, that no foreigner should enter Italy under arms; the\
other, that none of themselves should seize more territory. Those about\
whom there was the most anxiety were the Pope and the Venetians. To\
restrain the Venetians the union of all the others was necessary, as it\
was for the defence of Ferrara; and to keep down the Pope they made use\
of the barons of Rome, who, being divided into two factions, Orsini and\
Colonnesi, had always a pretext for disorder, and, standing with arms in\
their hands under the eyes of the Pontiff, kept the pontificate weak and\
powerless. And although there might arise sometimes a courageous pope,\
such as Sixtus, yet neither fortune nor wisdom could rid him of these\
annoyances. And the short life of a pope is also a cause of weakness;\
for in the ten years, which is the average life of a pope, he can with\
difficulty lower one of the factions; and if, so to speak, one people\
should almost destroy the Colonnesi, another would arise hostile to the\
Orsini, who would support their opponents, and yet would not have time\
to ruin the Orsini. This was the reason why the temporal powers of the\
pope were little esteemed in Italy.\
\
     (*) Charles VIII invaded Italy in 1494.\
\
Alexander the Sixth arose afterwards, who of all the pontiffs that\
have ever been showed how a pope with both money and arms was able to\
prevail; and through the instrumentality of the Duke Valentino, and by\
reason of the entry of the French, he brought about all those things\
which I have discussed above in the actions of the duke. And although\
his intention was not to aggrandize the Church, but the duke,\
nevertheless, what he did contributed to the greatness of the Church,\
which, after his death and the ruin of the duke, became the heir to all\
his labours.\
\
Pope Julius came afterwards and found the Church strong, possessing all\
the Romagna, the barons of Rome reduced to impotence, and, through the\
chastisements of Alexander, the factions wiped out; he also found\
the way open to accumulate money in a manner such as had never been\
practised before Alexander's time. Such things Julius not only followed,\
but improved upon, and he intended to gain Bologna, to ruin the\
Venetians, and to drive the French out of Italy. All of these\
enterprises prospered with him, and so much the more to his credit,\
inasmuch as he did everything to strengthen the Church and not any\
private person. He kept also the Orsini and Colonnesi factions within\
the bounds in which he found them; and although there was among them\
some mind to make disturbance, nevertheless he held two things firm: the\
one, the greatness of the Church, with which he terrified them; and the\
other, not allowing them to have their own cardinals, who caused the\
disorders among them. For whenever these factions have their cardinals\
they do not remain quiet for long, because cardinals foster the factions\
in Rome and out of it, and the barons are compelled to support them, and\
thus from the ambitions of prelates arise disorders and tumults among\
the barons. For these reasons his Holiness Pope Leo(*) found the\
pontificate most powerful, and it is to be hoped that, if others made it\
great in arms, he will make it still greater and more venerated by his\
goodness and infinite other virtues.\
\
     (*) Pope Leo X was the Cardinal de' Medici.\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XII -- HOW MANY KINDS OF SOLDIERY THERE ARE, AND CONCERNING\
MERCENARIES\
\
Having discoursed particularly on the characteristics of such\
principalities as in the beginning I proposed to discuss, and having\
considered in some degree the causes of their being good or bad, and\
having shown the methods by which many have sought to acquire them and\
to hold them, it now remains for me to discuss generally the means of\
offence and defence which belong to each of them.\
\
We have seen above how necessary it is for a prince to have his\
foundations well laid, otherwise it follows of necessity he will go\
to ruin. The chief foundations of all states, new as well as old or\
composite, are good laws and good arms; and as there cannot be good laws\
where the state is not well armed, it follows that where they are well\
armed they have good laws. I shall leave the laws out of the discussion\
and shall speak of the arms.\
\
I say, therefore, that the arms with which a prince defends his state\
are either his own, or they are mercenaries, auxiliaries, or mixed.\
Mercenaries and auxiliaries are useless and dangerous; and if one holds\
his state based on these arms, he will stand neither firm nor safe;\
for they are disunited, ambitious, and without discipline, unfaithful,\
valiant before friends, cowardly before enemies; they have neither the\
fear of God nor fidelity to men, and destruction is deferred only so\
long as the attack is; for in peace one is robbed by them, and in war\
by the enemy. The fact is, they have no other attraction or reason for\
keeping the field than a trifle of stipend, which is not sufficient\
to make them willing to die for you. They are ready enough to be\
your soldiers whilst you do not make war, but if war comes they take\
themselves off or run from the foe; which I should have little trouble\
to prove, for the ruin of Italy has been caused by nothing else than by\
resting all her hopes for many years on mercenaries, and although they\
formerly made some display and appeared valiant amongst themselves, yet\
when the foreigners came they showed what they were. Thus it was that\
Charles, King of France, was allowed to seize Italy with chalk in\
hand;(*) and he who told us that our sins were the cause of it told the\
truth, but they were not the sins he imagined, but those which I have\
related. And as they were the sins of princes, it is the princes who\
have also suffered the penalty.\
\
     (*) "With chalk in hand," "col gesso." This is one of the\
     _bons mots_ of Alexander VI, and refers to the ease with\
     which Charles VIII seized Italy, implying that it was only\
     necessary for him to send his quartermasters to chalk up the\
     billets for his soldiers to conquer the country. Cf. "The\
     History of Henry VII," by Lord Bacon: "King Charles had\
     conquered the realm of Naples, and lost it again, in a kind\
     of a felicity of a dream. He passed the whole length of\
     Italy without resistance: so that it was true what Pope\
     Alexander was wont to say: That the Frenchmen came into\
     Italy with chalk in their hands, to mark up their lodgings,\
     rather than with swords to fight."\
\
I wish to demonstrate further the infelicity of these arms. The\
mercenary captains are either capable men or they are not; if they\
are, you cannot trust them, because they always aspire to their own\
greatness, either by oppressing you, who are their master, or others\
contrary to your intentions; but if the captain is not skilful, you are\
ruined in the usual way.\
\
And if it be urged that whoever is armed will act in the same way,\
whether mercenary or not, I reply that when arms have to be resorted to,\
either by a prince or a republic, then the prince ought to go in\
person and perform the duty of a captain; the republic has to send its\
citizens, and when one is sent who does not turn out satisfactorily, it\
ought to recall him, and when one is worthy, to hold him by the laws so\
that he does not leave the command. And experience has shown princes and\
republics, single-handed, making the greatest progress, and mercenaries\
doing nothing except damage; and it is more difficult to bring a\
republic, armed with its own arms, under the sway of one of its citizens\
than it is to bring one armed with foreign arms. Rome and Sparta stood\
for many ages armed and free. The Switzers are completely armed and\
quite free.\
\
Of ancient mercenaries, for example, there are the Carthaginians, who\
were oppressed by their mercenary soldiers after the first war with the\
Romans, although the Carthaginians had their own citizens for captains.\
After the death of Epaminondas, Philip of Macedon was made captain of\
their soldiers by the Thebans, and after victory he took away their\
liberty.\
\
Duke Filippo being dead, the Milanese enlisted Francesco Sforza against\
the Venetians, and he, having overcome the enemy at Caravaggio,(*)\
allied himself with them to crush the Milanese, his masters. His father,\
Sforza, having been engaged by Queen Johanna(+) of Naples, left her\
unprotected, so that she was forced to throw herself into the arms of\
the King of Aragon, in order to save her kingdom. And if the Venetians\
and Florentines formerly extended their dominions by these arms, and yet\
their captains did not make themselves princes, but have defended them,\
I reply that the Florentines in this case have been favoured by chance,\
for of the able captains, of whom they might have stood in fear, some\
have not conquered, some have been opposed, and others have turned their\
ambitions elsewhere. One who did not conquer was Giovanni Acuto,(%) and\
since he did not conquer his fidelity cannot be proved; but every one\
will acknowledge that, had he conquered, the Florentines would have\
stood at his discretion. Sforza had the Bracceschi always against him,\
so they watched each other. Francesco turned his ambition to Lombardy;\
Braccio against the Church and the kingdom of Naples. But let us come\
to that which happened a short while ago. The Florentines appointed as\
their captain Pagolo Vitelli, a most prudent man, who from a private\
position had risen to the greatest renown. If this man had taken Pisa,\
nobody can deny that it would have been proper for the Florentines to\
keep in with him, for if he became the soldier of their enemies they had\
no means of resisting, and if they held to him they must obey him. The\
Venetians, if their achievements are considered, will be seen to have\
acted safely and gloriously so long as they sent to war their own men,\
when with armed gentlemen and plebians they did valiantly. This was\
before they turned to enterprises on land, but when they began to fight\
on land they forsook this virtue and followed the custom of Italy. And\
in the beginning of their expansion on land, through not having much\
territory, and because of their great reputation, they had not much\
to fear from their captains; but when they expanded, as under\
Carmignuola,(#) they had a taste of this mistake; for, having found him\
a most valiant man (they beat the Duke of Milan under his leadership),\
and, on the other hand, knowing how lukewarm he was in the war, they\
feared they would no longer conquer under him, and for this reason they\
were not willing, nor were they able, to let him go; and so, not to lose\
again that which they had acquired, they were compelled, in order to\
secure themselves, to murder him. They had afterwards for their\
captains Bartolomeo da Bergamo, Roberto da San Severino, the count of\
Pitigliano,(&) and the like, under whom they had to dread loss and not\
gain, as happened afterwards at Vaila,($) where in one battle they\
lost that which in eight hundred years they had acquired with so much\
trouble. Because from such arms conquests come but slowly, long delayed\
and inconsiderable, but the losses sudden and portentous.\
\
     (*) Battle of Caravaggio, 15th September 1448.\
\
     (+) Johanna II of Naples, the widow of Ladislao, King of\
     Naples.\
\
     (%) Giovanni Acuto. An English knight whose name was Sir\
     John Hawkwood. He fought in the English wars in France, and\
     was knighted by Edward III; afterwards he collected a body\
     of troops and went into Italy. These became the famous\
     "White Company." He took part in many wars, and died in\
     Florence in 1394. He was born about 1320 at Sible Hedingham,\
     a village in Essex. He married Domnia, a daughter of Bernabo\
     Visconti.\
\
     (#) Carmignuola. Francesco Bussone, born at Carmagnola about\
     1390, executed at Venice, 5th May 1432.\
\
     (&) Bartolomeo Colleoni of Bergamo; died 1457. Roberto of\
     San Severino; died fighting for Venice against Sigismund,\
     Duke of Austria, in 1487. "Primo capitano in Italia."--\
     Machiavelli. Count of Pitigliano; Nicolo Orsini, born 1442,\
     died 1510.\
\
     ($) Battle of Vaila in 1509.\
\
And as with these examples I have reached Italy, which has been ruled\
for many years by mercenaries, I wish to discuss them more seriously,\
in order that, having seen their rise and progress, one may be better\
prepared to counteract them. You must understand that the empire has\
recently come to be repudiated in Italy, that the Pope has acquired more\
temporal power, and that Italy has been divided up into more states,\
for the reason that many of the great cities took up arms against their\
nobles, who, formerly favoured by the emperor, were oppressing them,\
whilst the Church was favouring them so as to gain authority in temporal\
power: in many others their citizens became princes. From this it came\
to pass that Italy fell partly into the hands of the Church and of\
republics, and, the Church consisting of priests and the republic of\
citizens unaccustomed to arms, both commenced to enlist foreigners.\
\
The first who gave renown to this soldiery was Alberigo da Conio,(*) the\
Romagnian. From the school of this man sprang, among others, Braccio and\
Sforza, who in their time were the arbiters of Italy. After these came\
all the other captains who till now have directed the arms of Italy;\
and the end of all their valour has been, that she has been overrun\
by Charles, robbed by Louis, ravaged by Ferdinand, and insulted by the\
Switzers. The principle that has guided them has been, first, to lower\
the credit of infantry so that they might increase their own. They did\
this because, subsisting on their pay and without territory, they were\
unable to support many soldiers, and a few infantry did not give them\
any authority; so they were led to employ cavalry, with a moderate force\
of which they were maintained and honoured; and affairs were brought to\
such a pass that, in an army of twenty thousand soldiers, there were\
not to be found two thousand foot soldiers. They had, besides this, used\
every art to lessen fatigue and danger to themselves and their soldiers,\
not killing in the fray, but taking prisoners and liberating without\
ransom. They did not attack towns at night, nor did the garrisons of the\
towns attack encampments at night; they did not surround the camp either\
with stockade or ditch, nor did they campaign in the winter. All these\
things were permitted by their military rules, and devised by them to\
avoid, as I have said, both fatigue and dangers; thus they have brought\
Italy to slavery and contempt.\
\
     (*) Alberigo da Conio. Alberico da Barbiano, Count of Cunio\
     in Romagna. He was the leader of the famous "Company of St\
     George," composed entirely of Italian soldiers. He died in\
     1409.\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XIII -- CONCERNING AUXILIARIES, MIXED SOLDIERY, AND ONE'S OWN\
\
Auxiliaries, which are the other useless arm, are employed when a prince\
is called in with his forces to aid and defend, as was done by Pope\
Julius in the most recent times; for he, having, in the enterprise\
against Ferrara, had poor proof of his mercenaries, turned to\
auxiliaries, and stipulated with Ferdinand, King of Spain,(*) for his\
assistance with men and arms. These arms may be useful and good\
in themselves, but for him who calls them in they are always\
disadvantageous; for losing, one is undone, and winning, one is their\
captive.\
\
     (*) Ferdinand V (F. II of Aragon and Sicily, F. III of\
     Naples), surnamed "The Catholic," born 1452, died 1516.\
\
And although ancient histories may be full of examples, I do not wish\
to leave this recent one of Pope Julius the Second, the peril of which\
cannot fail to be perceived; for he, wishing to get Ferrara, threw\
himself entirely into the hands of the foreigner. But his good fortune\
brought about a third event, so that he did not reap the fruit of his\
rash choice; because, having his auxiliaries routed at Ravenna, and\
the Switzers having risen and driven out the conquerors (against all\
expectation, both his and others), it so came to pass that he did\
not become prisoner to his enemies, they having fled, nor to his\
auxiliaries, he having conquered by other arms than theirs.\
\
The Florentines, being entirely without arms, sent ten thousand\
Frenchmen to take Pisa, whereby they ran more danger than at any other\
time of their troubles.\
\
The Emperor of Constantinople,(*) to oppose his neighbours, sent ten\
thousand Turks into Greece, who, on the war being finished, were not\
willing to quit; this was the beginning of the servitude of Greece to\
the infidels.\
\
     (*) Joannes Cantacuzenus, born 1300, died 1383.\
\
Therefore, let him who has no desire to conquer make use of these arms,\
for they are much more hazardous than mercenaries, because with them the\
ruin is ready made; they are all united, all yield obedience to others;\
but with mercenaries, when they have conquered, more time and better\
opportunities are needed to injure you; they are not all of one\
community, they are found and paid by you, and a third party, which you\
have made their head, is not able all at once to assume enough authority\
to injure you. In conclusion, in mercenaries dastardy is most dangerous;\
in auxiliaries, valour. The wise prince, therefore, has always avoided\
these arms and turned to his own; and has been willing rather to lose\
with them than to conquer with the others, not deeming that a real\
victory which is gained with the arms of others.\
\
I shall never hesitate to cite Cesare Borgia and his actions. This duke\
entered the Romagna with auxiliaries, taking there only French soldiers,\
and with them he captured Imola and Forli; but afterwards, such forces\
not appearing to him reliable, he turned to mercenaries, discerning less\
danger in them, and enlisted the Orsini and Vitelli; whom presently,\
on handling and finding them doubtful, unfaithful, and dangerous, he\
destroyed and turned to his own men. And the difference between one\
and the other of these forces can easily be seen when one considers\
the difference there was in the reputation of the duke, when he had the\
French, when he had the Orsini and Vitelli, and when he relied on his\
own soldiers, on whose fidelity he could always count and found it ever\
increasing; he was never esteemed more highly than when every one saw\
that he was complete master of his own forces.\
\
I was not intending to go beyond Italian and recent examples, but I am\
unwilling to leave out Hiero, the Syracusan, he being one of those I\
have named above. This man, as I have said, made head of the army by the\
Syracusans, soon found out that a mercenary soldiery, constituted like\
our Italian condottieri, was of no use; and it appearing to him that he\
could neither keep them not let them go, he had them all cut to pieces,\
and afterwards made war with his own forces and not with aliens.\
\
I wish also to recall to memory an instance from the Old Testament\
applicable to this subject. David offered himself to Saul to fight with\
Goliath, the Philistine champion, and, to give him courage, Saul armed\
him with his own weapons; which David rejected as soon as he had them\
on his back, saying he could make no use of them, and that he wished to\
meet the enemy with his sling and his knife. In conclusion, the arms of\
others either fall from your back, or they weigh you down, or they bind\
you fast.\
\
Charles the Seventh,(*) the father of King Louis the Eleventh,(+) having\
by good fortune and valour liberated France from the English, recognized\
the necessity of being armed with forces of his own, and he established\
in his kingdom ordinances concerning men-at-arms and infantry.\
Afterwards his son, King Louis, abolished the infantry and began to\
enlist the Switzers, which mistake, followed by others, is, as is now\
seen, a source of peril to that kingdom; because, having raised the\
reputation of the Switzers, he has entirely diminished the value of\
his own arms, for he has destroyed the infantry altogether; and his\
men-at-arms he has subordinated to others, for, being as they are so\
accustomed to fight along with Switzers, it does not appear that they\
can now conquer without them. Hence it arises that the French cannot\
stand against the Switzers, and without the Switzers they do not come\
off well against others. The armies of the French have thus become\
mixed, partly mercenary and partly national, both of which arms together\
are much better than mercenaries alone or auxiliaries alone, but much\
inferior to one's own forces. And this example proves it, for the\
kingdom of France would be unconquerable if the ordinance of Charles had\
been enlarged or maintained.\
\
     (*) Charles VII of France, surnamed "The Victorious," born\
     1403, died 1461.\
\
     (+) Louis XI, son of the above, born 1423, died 1483.\
\
But the scanty wisdom of man, on entering into an affair which looks\
well at first, cannot discern the poison that is hidden in it, as I have\
said above of hectic fevers. Therefore, if he who rules a principality\
cannot recognize evils until they are upon him, he is not truly wise;\
and this insight is given to few. And if the first disaster to the Roman\
Empire(*) should be examined, it will be found to have commenced only\
with the enlisting of the Goths; because from that time the vigour of\
the Roman Empire began to decline, and all that valour which had raised\
it passed away to others.\
\
     (*) "Many speakers to the House the other night in the\
     debate on the reduction of armaments seemed to show a most\
     lamentable ignorance of the conditions under which the\
     British Empire maintains its existence. When Mr Balfour\
     replied to the allegations that the Roman Empire sank under\
     the weight of its military obligations, he said that this\
     was 'wholly unhistorical.' He might well have added that the\
     Roman power was at its zenith when every citizen\
     acknowledged his liability to fight for the State, but that\
     it began to decline as soon as this obligation was no longer\
     recognized."--Pall Mall Gazette, 15th May 1906.\
\
I conclude, therefore, that no principality is secure without having its\
own forces; on the contrary, it is entirely dependent on good fortune,\
not having the valour which in adversity would defend it. And it has\
always been the opinion and judgment of wise men that nothing can be so\
uncertain or unstable as fame or power not founded on its own strength.\
And one's own forces are those which are composed either of subjects,\
citizens, or dependents; all others are mercenaries or auxiliaries. And\
the way to make ready one's own forces will be easily found if the rules\
suggested by me shall be reflected upon, and if one will consider\
how Philip, the father of Alexander the Great, and many republics and\
princes have armed and organized themselves, to which rules I entirely\
commit myself.\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XIV -- THAT WHICH CONCERNS A PRINCE ON THE SUBJECT OF THE ART OF\
WAR\
\
A prince ought to have no other aim or thought, nor select anything else\
for his study, than war and its rules and discipline; for this is the\
sole art that belongs to him who rules, and it is of such force that it\
not only upholds those who are born princes, but it often enables men\
to rise from a private station to that rank. And, on the contrary, it is\
seen that when princes have thought more of ease than of arms they have\
lost their states. And the first cause of your losing it is to neglect\
this art; and what enables you to acquire a state is to be master of\
the art. Francesco Sforza, through being martial, from a private person\
became Duke of Milan; and the sons, through avoiding the hardships and\
troubles of arms, from dukes became private persons. For among other\
evils which being unarmed brings you, it causes you to be despised, and\
this is one of those ignominies against which a prince ought to guard\
himself, as is shown later on. Because there is nothing proportionate\
between the armed and the unarmed; and it is not reasonable that he who\
is armed should yield obedience willingly to him who is unarmed, or that\
the unarmed man should be secure among armed servants. Because, there\
being in the one disdain and in the other suspicion, it is not possible\
for them to work well together. And therefore a prince who does not\
understand the art of war, over and above the other misfortunes already\
mentioned, cannot be respected by his soldiers, nor can he rely on them.\
He ought never, therefore, to have out of his thoughts this subject of\
war, and in peace he should addict himself more to its exercise than in\
war; this he can do in two ways, the one by action, the other by study.\
\
As regards action, he ought above all things to keep his men well\
organized and drilled, to follow incessantly the chase, by which he\
accustoms his body to hardships, and learns something of the nature of\
localities, and gets to find out how the mountains rise, how the valleys\
open out, how the plains lie, and to understand the nature of rivers and\
marshes, and in all this to take the greatest care. Which knowledge\
is useful in two ways. Firstly, he learns to know his country, and\
is better able to undertake its defence; afterwards, by means of the\
knowledge and observation of that locality, he understands with ease any\
other which it may be necessary for him to study hereafter; because\
the hills, valleys, and plains, and rivers and marshes that are, for\
instance, in Tuscany, have a certain resemblance to those of other\
countries, so that with a knowledge of the aspect of one country one can\
easily arrive at a knowledge of others. And the prince that lacks this\
skill lacks the essential which it is desirable that a captain should\
possess, for it teaches him to surprise his enemy, to select quarters,\
to lead armies, to array the battle, to besiege towns to advantage.\
\
Philopoemen,(*) Prince of the Achaeans, among other praises which\
writers have bestowed on him, is commended because in time of peace he\
never had anything in his mind but the rules of war; and when he was in\
the country with friends, he often stopped and reasoned with them: "If\
the enemy should be upon that hill, and we should find ourselves here\
with our army, with whom would be the advantage? How should one best\
advance to meet him, keeping the ranks? If we should wish to retreat,\
how ought we to pursue?" And he would set forth to them, as he went, all\
the chances that could befall an army; he would listen to their opinion\
and state his, confirming it with reasons, so that by these continual\
discussions there could never arise, in time of war, any unexpected\
circumstances that he could not deal with.\
\
     (*) Philopoemen, "the last of the Greeks," born 252 B.C.,\
     died 183 B.C.\
\
But to exercise the intellect the prince should read histories, and\
study there the actions of illustrious men, to see how they have borne\
themselves in war, to examine the causes of their victories and defeat,\
so as to avoid the latter and imitate the former; and above all do as\
an illustrious man did, who took as an exemplar one who had been praised\
and famous before him, and whose achievements and deeds he always kept\
in his mind, as it is said Alexander the Great imitated Achilles, Caesar\
Alexander, Scipio Cyrus. And whoever reads the life of Cyrus, written\
by Xenophon, will recognize afterwards in the life of Scipio how that\
imitation was his glory, and how in chastity, affability, humanity, and\
liberality Scipio conformed to those things which have been written of\
Cyrus by Xenophon. A wise prince ought to observe some such rules, and\
never in peaceful times stand idle, but increase his resources with\
industry in such a way that they may be available to him in adversity,\
so that if fortune chances it may find him prepared to resist her blows.\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XV -- CONCERNING THINGS FOR WHICH MEN, AND ESPECIALLY PRINCES,\
ARE PRAISED OR BLAMED\
\
It remains now to see what ought to be the rules of conduct for a prince\
towards subject and friends. And as I know that many have written on\
this point, I expect I shall be considered presumptuous in mentioning it\
again, especially as in discussing it I shall depart from the methods of\
other people. But, it being my intention to write a thing which shall\
be useful to him who apprehends it, it appears to me more appropriate to\
follow up the real truth of the matter than the imagination of it; for\
many have pictured republics and principalities which in fact have never\
been known or seen, because how one lives is so far distant from how one\
ought to live, that he who neglects what is done for what ought to\
be done, sooner effects his ruin than his preservation; for a man who\
wishes to act entirely up to his professions of virtue soon meets with\
what destroys him among so much that is evil.\
\
Hence it is necessary for a prince wishing to hold his own to know\
how to do wrong, and to make use of it or not according to necessity.\
Therefore, putting on one side imaginary things concerning a prince, and\
discussing those which are real, I say that all men when they are spoken\
of, and chiefly princes for being more highly placed, are remarkable\
for some of those qualities which bring them either blame or praise; and\
thus it is that one is reputed liberal, another miserly, using a Tuscan\
term (because an avaricious person in our language is still he who\
desires to possess by robbery, whilst we call one miserly who deprives\
himself too much of the use of his own); one is reputed generous,\
one rapacious; one cruel, one compassionate; one faithless, another\
faithful; one effeminate and cowardly, another bold and brave; one\
affable, another haughty; one lascivious, another chaste; one sincere,\
another cunning; one hard, another easy; one grave, another frivolous;\
one religious, another unbelieving, and the like. And I know that every\
one will confess that it would be most praiseworthy in a prince to\
exhibit all the above qualities that are considered good; but because\
they can neither be entirely possessed nor observed, for human\
conditions do not permit it, it is necessary for him to be sufficiently\
prudent that he may know how to avoid the reproach of those vices which\
would lose him his state; and also to keep himself, if it be possible,\
from those which would not lose him it; but this not being possible, he\
may with less hesitation abandon himself to them. And again, he need\
not make himself uneasy at incurring a reproach for those vices without\
which the state can only be saved with difficulty, for if everything is\
considered carefully, it will be found that something which looks like\
virtue, if followed, would be his ruin; whilst something else, which\
looks like vice, yet followed brings him security and prosperity.\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XVI -- CONCERNING LIBERALITY AND MEANNESS\
\
Commencing then with the first of the above-named characteristics, I say\
that it would be well to be reputed liberal. Nevertheless, liberality\
exercised in a way that does not bring you the reputation for it,\
injures you; for if one exercises it honestly and as it should be\
exercised, it may not become known, and you will not avoid the reproach\
of its opposite. Therefore, any one wishing to maintain among men the\
name of liberal is obliged to avoid no attribute of magnificence; so\
that a prince thus inclined will consume in such acts all his property,\
and will be compelled in the end, if he wish to maintain the name\
of liberal, to unduly weigh down his people, and tax them, and do\
everything he can to get money. This will soon make him odious to his\
subjects, and becoming poor he will be little valued by any one; thus,\
with his liberality, having offended many and rewarded few, he is\
affected by the very first trouble and imperilled by whatever may be the\
first danger; recognizing this himself, and wishing to draw back from\
it, he runs at once into the reproach of being miserly.\
\
Therefore, a prince, not being able to exercise this virtue of\
liberality in such a way that it is recognized, except to his cost, if\
he is wise he ought not to fear the reputation of being mean, for in\
time he will come to be more considered than if liberal, seeing that\
with his economy his revenues are enough, that he can defend himself\
against all attacks, and is able to engage in enterprises without\
burdening his people; thus it comes to pass that he exercises liberality\
towards all from whom he does not take, who are numberless, and meanness\
towards those to whom he does not give, who are few.\
\
We have not seen great things done in our time except by those who have\
been considered mean; the rest have failed. Pope Julius the Second was\
assisted in reaching the papacy by a reputation for liberality, yet he\
did not strive afterwards to keep it up, when he made war on the King of\
France; and he made many wars without imposing any extraordinary tax on\
his subjects, for he supplied his additional expenses out of his long\
thriftiness. The present King of Spain would not have undertaken or\
conquered in so many enterprises if he had been reputed liberal. A\
prince, therefore, provided that he has not to rob his subjects, that he\
can defend himself, that he does not become poor and abject, that he\
is not forced to become rapacious, ought to hold of little account\
a reputation for being mean, for it is one of those vices which will\
enable him to govern.\
\
And if any one should say: Caesar obtained empire by liberality, and\
many others have reached the highest positions by having been liberal,\
and by being considered so, I answer: Either you are a prince in\
fact, or in a way to become one. In the first case this liberality is\
dangerous, in the second it is very necessary to be considered liberal;\
and Caesar was one of those who wished to become pre-eminent in Rome;\
but if he had survived after becoming so, and had not moderated his\
expenses, he would have destroyed his government. And if any one should\
reply: Many have been princes, and have done great things with armies,\
who have been considered very liberal, I reply: Either a prince spends\
that which is his own or his subjects' or else that of others. In the\
first case he ought to be sparing, in the second he ought not to neglect\
any opportunity for liberality. And to the prince who goes forth with\
his army, supporting it by pillage, sack, and extortion, handling that\
which belongs to others, this liberality is necessary, otherwise he\
would not be followed by soldiers. And of that which is neither yours\
nor your subjects' you can be a ready giver, as were Cyrus, Caesar, and\
Alexander; because it does not take away your reputation if you squander\
that of others, but adds to it; it is only squandering your own that\
injures you.\
\
And there is nothing wastes so rapidly as liberality, for even whilst\
you exercise it you lose the power to do so, and so become either poor\
or despised, or else, in avoiding poverty, rapacious and hated. And a\
prince should guard himself, above all things, against being despised\
and hated; and liberality leads you to both. Therefore it is wiser to\
have a reputation for meanness which brings reproach without hatred,\
than to be compelled through seeking a reputation for liberality to\
incur a name for rapacity which begets reproach with hatred.\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XVII -- CONCERNING CRUELTY AND CLEMENCY, AND WHETHER IT IS\
BETTER TO BE LOVED THAN FEARED\
\
Coming now to the other qualities mentioned above, I say that every\
prince ought to desire to be considered clement and not cruel.\
Nevertheless he ought to take care not to misuse this clemency. Cesare\
Borgia was considered cruel; notwithstanding, his cruelty reconciled the\
Romagna, unified it, and restored it to peace and loyalty. And if this\
be rightly considered, he will be seen to have been much more merciful\
than the Florentine people, who, to avoid a reputation for cruelty,\
permitted Pistoia to be destroyed.(*) Therefore a prince, so long as he\
keeps his subjects united and loyal, ought not to mind the reproach of\
cruelty; because with a few examples he will be more merciful than those\
who, through too much mercy, allow disorders to arise, from which follow\
murders or robberies; for these are wont to injure the whole people,\
whilst those executions which originate with a prince offend the\
individual only.\
\
     (*) During the rioting between the Cancellieri and\
     Panciatichi factions in 1502 and 1503.\
\
And of all princes, it is impossible for the new prince to avoid the\
imputation of cruelty, owing to new states being full of dangers. Hence\
Virgil, through the mouth of Dido, excuses the inhumanity of her reign\
owing to its being new, saying:\
\
     "Res dura, et regni novitas me talia cogunt\
     Moliri, et late fines custode tueri."(*)\
\
Nevertheless he ought to be slow to believe and to act, nor should he\
himself show fear, but proceed in a temperate manner with prudence and\
humanity, so that too much confidence may not make him incautious and\
too much distrust render him intolerable.\
\
     (*) . . . against my will, my fate\
     A throne unsettled, and an infant state,\
     Bid me defend my realms with all my pow'rs,\
     And guard with these severities my shores.\
\
     Christopher Pitt.\
\
Upon this a question arises: whether it be better to be loved than\
feared or feared than loved? It may be answered that one should wish to\
be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, it\
is much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be\
dispensed with. Because this is to be asserted in general of men, that\
they are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as\
you succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you their blood,\
property, life, and children, as is said above, when the need is far\
distant; but when it approaches they turn against you. And that\
prince who, relying entirely on their promises, has neglected other\
precautions, is ruined; because friendships that are obtained by\
payments, and not by greatness or nobility of mind, may indeed be\
earned, but they are not secured, and in time of need cannot be relied\
upon; and men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than one\
who is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation which,\
owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their\
advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never\
fails.\
\
Nevertheless a prince ought to inspire fear in such a way that, if he\
does not win love, he avoids hatred; because he can endure very well\
being feared whilst he is not hated, which will always be as long as he\
abstains from the property of his citizens and subjects and from their\
women. But when it is necessary for him to proceed against the life of\
someone, he must do it on proper justification and for manifest cause,\
but above all things he must keep his hands off the property of others,\
because men more quickly forget the death of their father than the loss\
of their patrimony. Besides, pretexts for taking away the property are\
never wanting; for he who has once begun to live by robbery will always\
find pretexts for seizing what belongs to others; but reasons for taking\
life, on the contrary, are more difficult to find and sooner lapse. But\
when a prince is with his army, and has under control a multitude of\
soldiers, then it is quite necessary for him to disregard the reputation\
of cruelty, for without it he would never hold his army united or\
disposed to its duties.\
\
Among the wonderful deeds of Hannibal this one is enumerated: that\
having led an enormous army, composed of many various races of men,\
to fight in foreign lands, no dissensions arose either among them or\
against the prince, whether in his bad or in his good fortune. This\
arose from nothing else than his inhuman cruelty, which, with his\
boundless valour, made him revered and terrible in the sight of\
his soldiers, but without that cruelty, his other virtues were not\
sufficient to produce this effect. And short-sighted writers admire\
his deeds from one point of view and from another condemn the principal\
cause of them. That it is true his other virtues would not have been\
sufficient for him may be proved by the case of Scipio, that most\
excellent man, not only of his own times but within the memory of man,\
against whom, nevertheless, his army rebelled in Spain; this arose from\
nothing but his too great forbearance, which gave his soldiers more\
license than is consistent with military discipline. For this he was\
upbraided in the Senate by Fabius Maximus, and called the corrupter of\
the Roman soldiery. The Locrians were laid waste by a legate of Scipio,\
yet they were not avenged by him, nor was the insolence of the legate\
punished, owing entirely to his easy nature. Insomuch that someone in\
the Senate, wishing to excuse him, said there were many men who knew\
much better how not to err than to correct the errors of others.\
This disposition, if he had been continued in the command, would have\
destroyed in time the fame and glory of Scipio; but, he being under the\
control of the Senate, this injurious characteristic not only concealed\
itself, but contributed to his glory.\
\
Returning to the question of being feared or loved, I come to the\
conclusion that, men loving according to their own will and fearing\
according to that of the prince, a wise prince should establish himself\
on that which is in his own control and not in that of others; he must\
endeavour only to avoid hatred, as is noted.\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XVIII(*) -- CONCERNING THE WAY IN WHICH PRINCES SHOULD KEEP\
FAITH\
\
     (*) "The present chapter has given greater offence than any\
     other portion of Machiavelli's writings." Burd, "Il\
     Principe," p. 297.\
\
Every one admits how praiseworthy it is in a prince to keep faith, and\
to live with integrity and not with craft. Nevertheless our experience\
has been that those princes who have done great things have held good\
faith of little account, and have known how to circumvent the intellect\
of men by craft, and in the end have overcome those who have relied on\
their word. You must know there are two ways of contesting,(*) the one\
by the law, the other by force; the first method is proper to men, the\
second to beasts; but because the first is frequently not sufficient, it\
is necessary to have recourse to the second. Therefore it is necessary\
for a prince to understand how to avail himself of the beast and the\
man. This has been figuratively taught to princes by ancient writers,\
who describe how Achilles and many other princes of old were given to\
the Centaur Chiron to nurse, who brought them up in his discipline;\
which means solely that, as they had for a teacher one who was half\
beast and half man, so it is necessary for a prince to know how to make\
use of both natures, and that one without the other is not durable. A\
prince, therefore, being compelled knowingly to adopt the beast, ought\
to choose the fox and the lion; because the lion cannot defend himself\
against snares and the fox cannot defend himself against wolves.\
Therefore, it is necessary to be a fox to discover the snares and a\
lion to terrify the wolves. Those who rely simply on the lion do not\
understand what they are about. Therefore a wise lord cannot, nor ought\
he to, keep faith when such observance may be turned against him, and\
when the reasons that caused him to pledge it exist no longer. If men\
were entirely good this precept would not hold, but because they are\
bad, and will not keep faith with you, you too are not bound to observe\
it with them. Nor will there ever be wanting to a prince legitimate\
reasons to excuse this non-observance. Of this endless modern examples\
could be given, showing how many treaties and engagements have been made\
void and of no effect through the faithlessness of princes; and he who\
has known best how to employ the fox has succeeded best.\
\
     (*) "Contesting," i.e. "striving for mastery." Mr Burd\
     points out that this passage is imitated directly from\
     Cicero's "De Officiis": "Nam cum sint duo genera decertandi,\
     unum per disceptationem, alterum per vim; cumque illud\
     proprium sit hominis, hoc beluarum; confugiendum est ad\
     posterius, si uti non licet superiore."\
\
But it is necessary to know well how to disguise this characteristic,\
and to be a great pretender and dissembler; and men are so simple, and\
so subject to present necessities, that he who seeks to deceive will\
always find someone who will allow himself to be deceived. One recent\
example I cannot pass over in silence. Alexander the Sixth did nothing\
else but deceive men, nor ever thought of doing otherwise, and he\
always found victims; for there never was a man who had greater power\
in asserting, or who with greater oaths would affirm a thing, yet would\
observe it less; nevertheless his deceits always succeeded according to\
his wishes,(*) because he well understood this side of mankind.\
\
     (*) "Nondimanco sempre gli succederono gli inganni (ad\
     votum)." The words "ad votum" are omitted in the Testina\
     addition, 1550.\
\
     Alexander never did what he said,\
     Cesare never said what he did.\
\
     Italian Proverb.\
\
Therefore it is unnecessary for a prince to have all the good qualities\
I have enumerated, but it is very necessary to appear to have them. And\
I shall dare to say this also, that to have them and always to observe\
them is injurious, and that to appear to have them is useful; to appear\
merciful, faithful, humane, religious, upright, and to be so, but with a\
mind so framed that should you require not to be so, you may be able and\
know how to change to the opposite.\
\
And you have to understand this, that a prince, especially a new one,\
cannot observe all those things for which men are esteemed, being often\
forced, in order to maintain the state, to act contrary to fidelity,(*)\
friendship, humanity, and religion. Therefore it is necessary for him to\
have a mind ready to turn itself accordingly as the winds and variations\
of fortune force it, yet, as I have said above, not to diverge from the\
good if he can avoid doing so, but, if compelled, then to know how to\
set about it.\
\
     (*) "Contrary to fidelity" or "faith," "contro alla fede,"\
     and "tutto fede," "altogether faithful," in the next\
     paragraph. It is noteworthy that these two phrases, "contro\
     alla fede" and "tutto fede," were omitted in the Testina\
     edition, which was published with the sanction of the papal\
     authorities. It may be that the meaning attached to the word\
     "fede" was "the faith," i.e. the Catholic creed, and not as\
     rendered here "fidelity" and "faithful." Observe that the\
     word "religione" was suffered to stand in the text of the\
     Testina, being used to signify indifferently every shade of\
     belief, as witness "the religion," a phrase inevitably\
     employed to designate the Huguenot heresy. South in his\
     Sermon IX, p. 69, ed. 1843, comments on this passage as\
     follows: "That great patron and Coryphaeus of this tribe,\
     Nicolo Machiavel, laid down this for a master rule in his\
     political scheme: 'That the show of religion was helpful to\
     the politician, but the reality of it hurtful and\
     pernicious.'"\
\
For this reason a prince ought to take care that he never lets anything\
slip from his lips that is not replete with the above-named five\
qualities, that he may appear to him who sees and hears him altogether\
merciful, faithful, humane, upright, and religious. There is nothing\
more necessary to appear to have than this last quality, inasmuch as men\
judge generally more by the eye than by the hand, because it belongs to\
everybody to see you, to few to come in touch with you. Every one sees\
what you appear to be, few really know what you are, and those few dare\
not oppose themselves to the opinion of the many, who have the majesty\
of the state to defend them; and in the actions of all men, and\
especially of princes, which it is not prudent to challenge, one judges\
by the result.\
\
For that reason, let a prince have the credit of conquering and holding\
his state, the means will always be considered honest, and he will be\
praised by everybody; because the vulgar are always taken by what a\
thing seems to be and by what comes of it; and in the world there are\
only the vulgar, for the few find a place there only when the many have\
no ground to rest on.\
\
One prince(*) of the present time, whom it is not well to name, never\
preaches anything else but peace and good faith, and to both he is\
most hostile, and either, if he had kept it, would have deprived him of\
reputation and kingdom many a time.\
\
     (*) Ferdinand of Aragon. "When Machiavelli was writing 'The\
     Prince' it would have been clearly impossible to mention\
     Ferdinand's name here without giving offence." Burd's "Il\
     Principe," p. 308.\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XIX -- THAT ONE SHOULD AVOID BEING DESPISED AND HATED\
\
Now, concerning the characteristics of which mention is made above, I\
have spoken of the more important ones, the others I wish to discuss\
briefly under this generality, that the prince must consider, as has\
been in part said before, how to avoid those things which will make him\
hated or contemptible; and as often as he shall have succeeded he\
will have fulfilled his part, and he need not fear any danger in other\
reproaches.\
\
It makes him hated above all things, as I have said, to be rapacious,\
and to be a violator of the property and women of his subjects, from\
both of which he must abstain. And when neither their property nor their\
honor is touched, the majority of men live content, and he has only to\
contend with the ambition of a few, whom he can curb with ease in many\
ways.\
\
It makes him contemptible to be considered fickle, frivolous,\
effeminate, mean-spirited, irresolute, from all of which a prince should\
guard himself as from a rock; and he should endeavour to show in his\
actions greatness, courage, gravity, and fortitude; and in his\
private dealings with his subjects let him show that his judgments are\
irrevocable, and maintain himself in such reputation that no one can\
hope either to deceive him or to get round him.\
\
That prince is highly esteemed who conveys this impression of himself,\
and he who is highly esteemed is not easily conspired against; for,\
provided it is well known that he is an excellent man and revered by\
his people, he can only be attacked with difficulty. For this reason\
a prince ought to have two fears, one from within, on account of his\
subjects, the other from without, on account of external powers. From\
the latter he is defended by being well armed and having good allies,\
and if he is well armed he will have good friends, and affairs will\
always remain quiet within when they are quiet without, unless they\
should have been already disturbed by conspiracy; and even should\
affairs outside be disturbed, if he has carried out his preparations and\
has lived as I have said, as long as he does not despair, he will resist\
every attack, as I said Nabis the Spartan did.\
\
But concerning his subjects, when affairs outside are disturbed he has\
only to fear that they will conspire secretly, from which a prince\
can easily secure himself by avoiding being hated and despised, and by\
keeping the people satisfied with him, which it is most necessary\
for him to accomplish, as I said above at length. And one of the most\
efficacious remedies that a prince can have against conspiracies is not\
to be hated and despised by the people, for he who conspires against\
a prince always expects to please them by his removal; but when the\
conspirator can only look forward to offending them, he will not have\
the courage to take such a course, for the difficulties that confront\
a conspirator are infinite. And as experience shows, many have been the\
conspiracies, but few have been successful; because he who conspires\
cannot act alone, nor can he take a companion except from those whom he\
believes to be malcontents, and as soon as you have opened your mind\
to a malcontent you have given him the material with which to content\
himself, for by denouncing you he can look for every advantage; so that,\
seeing the gain from this course to be assured, and seeing the other\
to be doubtful and full of dangers, he must be a very rare friend, or a\
thoroughly obstinate enemy of the prince, to keep faith with you.\
\
And, to reduce the matter into a small compass, I say that, on the side\
of the conspirator, there is nothing but fear, jealousy, prospect of\
punishment to terrify him; but on the side of the prince there is the\
majesty of the principality, the laws, the protection of friends and\
the state to defend him; so that, adding to all these things the\
popular goodwill, it is impossible that any one should be so rash as to\
conspire. For whereas in general the conspirator has to fear before the\
execution of his plot, in this case he has also to fear the sequel to\
the crime; because on account of it he has the people for an enemy, and\
thus cannot hope for any escape.\
\
Endless examples could be given on this subject, but I will be content\
with one, brought to pass within the memory of our fathers. Messer\
Annibale Bentivogli, who was prince in Bologna (grandfather of the\
present Annibale), having been murdered by the Canneschi, who had\
conspired against him, not one of his family survived but Messer\
Giovanni,(*) who was in childhood: immediately after his assassination\
the people rose and murdered all the Canneschi. This sprung from the\
popular goodwill which the house of Bentivogli enjoyed in those days in\
Bologna; which was so great that, although none remained there after the\
death of Annibale who was able to rule the state, the Bolognese, having\
information that there was one of the Bentivogli family in Florence,\
who up to that time had been considered the son of a blacksmith, sent to\
Florence for him and gave him the government of their city, and it was\
ruled by him until Messer Giovanni came in due course to the government.\
\
     (*) Giovanni Bentivogli, born in Bologna 1438, died at Milan\
     1508. He ruled Bologna from 1462 to 1506. Machiavelli's\
     strong condemnation of conspiracies may get its edge from\
     his own very recent experience (February 1513), when he had\
     been arrested and tortured for his alleged complicity in the\
     Boscoli conspiracy.\
\
For this reason I consider that a prince ought to reckon conspiracies\
of little account when his people hold him in esteem; but when it\
is hostile to him, and bears hatred towards him, he ought to fear\
everything and everybody. And well-ordered states and wise princes have\
taken every care not to drive the nobles to desperation, and to keep the\
people satisfied and contented, for this is one of the most important\
objects a prince can have.\
\
Among the best ordered and governed kingdoms of our times is France, and\
in it are found many good institutions on which depend the liberty\
and security of the king; of these the first is the parliament and its\
authority, because he who founded the kingdom, knowing the ambition of\
the nobility and their boldness, considered that a bit to their mouths\
would be necessary to hold them in; and, on the other side, knowing the\
hatred of the people, founded in fear, against the nobles, he wished to\
protect them, yet he was not anxious for this to be the particular care\
of the king; therefore, to take away the reproach which he would be\
liable to from the nobles for favouring the people, and from the people\
for favouring the nobles, he set up an arbiter, who should be one who\
could beat down the great and favour the lesser without reproach to the\
king. Neither could you have a better or a more prudent arrangement, or\
a greater source of security to the king and kingdom. From this one can\
draw another important conclusion, that princes ought to leave affairs\
of reproach to the management of others, and keep those of grace in\
their own hands. And further, I consider that a prince ought to cherish\
the nobles, but not so as to make himself hated by the people.\
\
It may appear, perhaps, to some who have examined the lives and deaths\
of the Roman emperors that many of them would be an example contrary\
to my opinion, seeing that some of them lived nobly and showed great\
qualities of soul, nevertheless they have lost their empire or have been\
killed by subjects who have conspired against them. Wishing, therefore,\
to answer these objections, I will recall the characters of some of the\
emperors, and will show that the causes of their ruin were not different\
to those alleged by me; at the same time I will only submit for\
consideration those things that are noteworthy to him who studies the\
affairs of those times.\
\
It seems to me sufficient to take all those emperors who succeeded to\
the empire from Marcus the philosopher down to Maximinus; they were\
Marcus and his son Commodus, Pertinax, Julian, Severus and his son\
Antoninus Caracalla, Macrinus, Heliogabalus, Alexander, and Maximinus.\
\
There is first to note that, whereas in other principalities the\
ambition of the nobles and the insolence of the people only have to be\
contended with, the Roman emperors had a third difficulty in having to\
put up with the cruelty and avarice of their soldiers, a matter so beset\
with difficulties that it was the ruin of many; for it was a hard thing\
to give satisfaction both to soldiers and people; because the people\
loved peace, and for this reason they loved the unaspiring prince,\
whilst the soldiers loved the warlike prince who was bold, cruel, and\
rapacious, which qualities they were quite willing he should exercise\
upon the people, so that they could get double pay and give vent to\
their own greed and cruelty. Hence it arose that those emperors were\
always overthrown who, either by birth or training, had no great\
authority, and most of them, especially those who came new to the\
principality, recognizing the difficulty of these two opposing humours,\
were inclined to give satisfaction to the soldiers, caring little about\
injuring the people. Which course was necessary, because, as princes\
cannot help being hated by someone, they ought, in the first place, to\
avoid being hated by every one, and when they cannot compass this, they\
ought to endeavour with the utmost diligence to avoid the hatred of the\
most powerful. Therefore, those emperors who through inexperience had\
need of special favour adhered more readily to the soldiers than to\
the people; a course which turned out advantageous to them or not,\
accordingly as the prince knew how to maintain authority over them.\
\
From these causes it arose that Marcus, Pertinax, and Alexander, being\
all men of modest life, lovers of justice, enemies to cruelty, humane,\
and benignant, came to a sad end except Marcus; he alone lived and died\
honoured, because he had succeeded to the throne by hereditary title,\
and owed nothing either to the soldiers or the people; and afterwards,\
being possessed of many virtues which made him respected, he always kept\
both orders in their places whilst he lived, and was neither hated nor\
despised.\
\
But Pertinax was created emperor against the wishes of the soldiers,\
who, being accustomed to live licentiously under Commodus, could not\
endure the honest life to which Pertinax wished to reduce them; thus,\
having given cause for hatred, to which hatred there was added contempt\
for his old age, he was overthrown at the very beginning of his\
administration. And here it should be noted that hatred is acquired as\
much by good works as by bad ones, therefore, as I said before, a prince\
wishing to keep his state is very often forced to do evil; for when that\
body is corrupt whom you think you have need of to maintain yourself--it\
may be either the people or the soldiers or the nobles--you have to\
submit to its humours and to gratify them, and then good works will do\
you harm.\
\
But let us come to Alexander, who was a man of such great goodness,\
that among the other praises which are accorded him is this, that in the\
fourteen years he held the empire no one was ever put to death by\
him unjudged; nevertheless, being considered effeminate and a man who\
allowed himself to be governed by his mother, he became despised, the\
army conspired against him, and murdered him.\
\
Turning now to the opposite characters of Commodus, Severus, Antoninus\
Caracalla, and Maximinus, you will find them all cruel and rapacious-men\
who, to satisfy their soldiers, did not hesitate to commit every kind of\
iniquity against the people; and all, except Severus, came to a bad\
end; but in Severus there was so much valour that, keeping the soldiers\
friendly, although the people were oppressed by him, he reigned\
successfully; for his valour made him so much admired in the sight of\
the soldiers and people that the latter were kept in a way astonished\
and awed and the former respectful and satisfied. And because the\
actions of this man, as a new prince, were great, I wish to show\
briefly that he knew well how to counterfeit the fox and the lion, which\
natures, as I said above, it is necessary for a prince to imitate.\
\
Knowing the sloth of the Emperor Julian, he persuaded the army in\
Sclavonia, of which he was captain, that it would be right to go to Rome\
and avenge the death of Pertinax, who had been killed by the praetorian\
soldiers; and under this pretext, without appearing to aspire to the\
throne, he moved the army on Rome, and reached Italy before it was known\
that he had started. On his arrival at Rome, the Senate, through fear,\
elected him emperor and killed Julian. After this there remained for\
Severus, who wished to make himself master of the whole empire, two\
difficulties; one in Asia, where Niger, head of the Asiatic army, had\
caused himself to be proclaimed emperor; the other in the west where\
Albinus was, who also aspired to the throne. And as he considered it\
dangerous to declare himself hostile to both, he decided to attack\
Niger and to deceive Albinus. To the latter he wrote that, being elected\
emperor by the Senate, he was willing to share that dignity with him and\
sent him the title of Caesar; and, moreover, that the Senate had made\
Albinus his colleague; which things were accepted by Albinus as true.\
But after Severus had conquered and killed Niger, and settled oriental\
affairs, he returned to Rome and complained to the Senate that Albinus,\
little recognizing the benefits that he had received from him, had\
by treachery sought to murder him, and for this ingratitude he was\
compelled to punish him. Afterwards he sought him out in France, and\
took from him his government and life. He who will, therefore, carefully\
examine the actions of this man will find him a most valiant lion and\
a most cunning fox; he will find him feared and respected by every one,\
and not hated by the army; and it need not be wondered at that he, a\
new man, was able to hold the empire so well, because his supreme\
renown always protected him from that hatred which the people might have\
conceived against him for his violence.\
\
But his son Antoninus was a most eminent man, and had very excellent\
qualities, which made him admirable in the sight of the people and\
acceptable to the soldiers, for he was a warlike man, most enduring\
of fatigue, a despiser of all delicate food and other luxuries, which\
caused him to be beloved by the armies. Nevertheless, his ferocity and\
cruelties were so great and so unheard of that, after endless single\
murders, he killed a large number of the people of Rome and all those of\
Alexandria. He became hated by the whole world, and also feared by those\
he had around him, to such an extent that he was murdered in the midst\
of his army by a centurion. And here it must be noted that such-like\
deaths, which are deliberately inflicted with a resolved and desperate\
courage, cannot be avoided by princes, because any one who does not fear\
to die can inflict them; but a prince may fear them the less because\
they are very rare; he has only to be careful not to do any grave injury\
to those whom he employs or has around him in the service of the state.\
Antoninus had not taken this care, but had contumeliously killed a\
brother of that centurion, whom also he daily threatened, yet retained\
in his bodyguard; which, as it turned out, was a rash thing to do, and\
proved the emperor's ruin.\
\
But let us come to Commodus, to whom it should have been very easy to\
hold the empire, for, being the son of Marcus, he had inherited it,\
and he had only to follow in the footsteps of his father to please his\
people and soldiers; but, being by nature cruel and brutal, he gave\
himself up to amusing the soldiers and corrupting them, so that he might\
indulge his rapacity upon the people; on the other hand, not maintaining\
his dignity, often descending to the theatre to compete with gladiators,\
and doing other vile things, little worthy of the imperial majesty, he\
fell into contempt with the soldiers, and being hated by one party and\
despised by the other, he was conspired against and was killed.\
\
It remains to discuss the character of Maximinus. He was a very warlike\
man, and the armies, being disgusted with the effeminacy of Alexander,\
of whom I have already spoken, killed him and elected Maximinus to the\
throne. This he did not possess for long, for two things made him hated\
and despised; the one, his having kept sheep in Thrace, which brought\
him into contempt (it being well known to all, and considered a great\
indignity by every one), and the other, his having at the accession\
to his dominions deferred going to Rome and taking possession of the\
imperial seat; he had also gained a reputation for the utmost ferocity\
by having, through his prefects in Rome and elsewhere in the empire,\
practised many cruelties, so that the whole world was moved to anger\
at the meanness of his birth and to fear at his barbarity. First Africa\
rebelled, then the Senate with all the people of Rome, and all Italy\
conspired against him, to which may be added his own army; this latter,\
besieging Aquileia and meeting with difficulties in taking it, were\
disgusted with his cruelties, and fearing him less when they found so\
many against him, murdered him.\
\
I do not wish to discuss Heliogabalus, Macrinus, or Julian, who, being\
thoroughly contemptible, were quickly wiped out; but I will bring this\
discourse to a conclusion by saying that princes in our times have this\
difficulty of giving inordinate satisfaction to their soldiers in a\
far less degree, because, notwithstanding one has to give them some\
indulgence, that is soon done; none of these princes have armies that\
are veterans in the governance and administration of provinces, as were\
the armies of the Roman Empire; and whereas it was then more necessary\
to give satisfaction to the soldiers than to the people, it is now more\
necessary to all princes, except the Turk and the Soldan, to satisfy the\
people rather the soldiers, because the people are the more powerful.\
\
From the above I have excepted the Turk, who always keeps round him\
twelve thousand infantry and fifteen thousand cavalry on which depend\
the security and strength of the kingdom, and it is necessary that,\
putting aside every consideration for the people, he should keep them\
his friends. The kingdom of the Soldan is similar; being entirely in the\
hands of soldiers, it follows again that, without regard to the people,\
he must keep them his friends. But you must note that the state of the\
Soldan is unlike all other principalities, for the reason that it\
is like the Christian pontificate, which cannot be called either an\
hereditary or a newly formed principality; because the sons of the old\
prince are not the heirs, but he who is elected to that position by\
those who have authority, and the sons remain only noblemen. And this\
being an ancient custom, it cannot be called a new principality, because\
there are none of those difficulties in it that are met with in new\
ones; for although the prince is new, the constitution of the state is\
old, and it is framed so as to receive him as if he were its hereditary\
lord.\
\
But returning to the subject of our discourse, I say that whoever will\
consider it will acknowledge that either hatred or contempt has been\
fatal to the above-named emperors, and it will be recognized also how\
it happened that, a number of them acting in one way and a number\
in another, only one in each way came to a happy end and the rest to\
unhappy ones. Because it would have been useless and dangerous for\
Pertinax and Alexander, being new princes, to imitate Marcus, who\
was heir to the principality; and likewise it would have been utterly\
destructive to Caracalla, Commodus, and Maximinus to have imitated\
Severus, they not having sufficient valour to enable them to tread\
in his footsteps. Therefore a prince, new to the principality, cannot\
imitate the actions of Marcus, nor, again, is it necessary to follow\
those of Severus, but he ought to take from Severus those parts which\
are necessary to found his state, and from Marcus those which are proper\
and glorious to keep a state that may already be stable and firm.\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XX -- ARE FORTRESSES, AND MANY OTHER THINGS TO WHICH PRINCES\
OFTEN RESORT, ADVANTAGEOUS OR HURTFUL?\
\
1. Some princes, so as to hold securely the state, have disarmed their\
subjects; others have kept their subject towns distracted by factions;\
others have fostered enmities against themselves; others have laid\
themselves out to gain over those whom they distrusted in the beginning\
of their governments; some have built fortresses; some have overthrown\
and destroyed them. And although one cannot give a final judgment on all\
of these things unless one possesses the particulars of those states\
in which a decision has to be made, nevertheless I will speak as\
comprehensively as the matter of itself will admit.\
\
2. There never was a new prince who has disarmed his subjects; rather\
when he has found them disarmed he has always armed them, because, by\
arming them, those arms become yours, those men who were distrusted\
become faithful, and those who were faithful are kept so, and your\
subjects become your adherents. And whereas all subjects cannot be\
armed, yet when those whom you do arm are benefited, the others can be\
handled more freely, and this difference in their treatment, which they\
quite understand, makes the former your dependents, and the latter,\
considering it to be necessary that those who have the most danger and\
service should have the most reward, excuse you. But when you disarm\
them, you at once offend them by showing that you distrust them, either\
for cowardice or for want of loyalty, and either of these opinions\
breeds hatred against you. And because you cannot remain unarmed, it\
follows that you turn to mercenaries, which are of the character already\
shown; even if they should be good they would not be sufficient to\
defend you against powerful enemies and distrusted subjects. Therefore,\
as I have said, a new prince in a new principality has always\
distributed arms. Histories are full of examples. But when a prince\
acquires a new state, which he adds as a province to his old one, then\
it is necessary to disarm the men of that state, except those who have\
been his adherents in acquiring it; and these again, with time and\
opportunity, should be rendered soft and effeminate; and matters should\
be managed in such a way that all the armed men in the state shall be\
your own soldiers who in your old state were living near you.\
\
3. Our forefathers, and those who were reckoned wise, were accustomed\
to say that it was necessary to hold Pistoia by factions and Pisa by\
fortresses; and with this idea they fostered quarrels in some of their\
tributary towns so as to keep possession of them the more easily.\
This may have been well enough in those times when Italy was in a way\
balanced, but I do not believe that it can be accepted as a precept\
for to-day, because I do not believe that factions can ever be of use;\
rather it is certain that when the enemy comes upon you in divided\
cities you are quickly lost, because the weakest party will always\
assist the outside forces and the other will not be able to resist.\
The Venetians, moved, as I believe, by the above reasons, fostered the\
Guelph and Ghibelline factions in their tributary cities; and although\
they never allowed them to come to bloodshed, yet they nursed these\
disputes amongst them, so that the citizens, distracted by their\
differences, should not unite against them. Which, as we saw, did not\
afterwards turn out as expected, because, after the rout at Vaila, one\
party at once took courage and seized the state. Such methods argue,\
therefore, weakness in the prince, because these factions will never be\
permitted in a vigorous principality; such methods for enabling one the\
more easily to manage subjects are only useful in times of peace, but if\
war comes this policy proves fallacious.\
\
4. Without doubt princes become great when they overcome the\
difficulties and obstacles by which they are confronted, and therefore\
fortune, especially when she desires to make a new prince great, who\
has a greater necessity to earn renown than an hereditary one, causes\
enemies to arise and form designs against him, in order that he may have\
the opportunity of overcoming them, and by them to mount higher, as by a\
ladder which his enemies have raised. For this reason many consider that\
a wise prince, when he has the opportunity, ought with craft to foster\
some animosity against himself, so that, having crushed it, his renown\
may rise higher.\
\
5. Princes, especially new ones, have found more fidelity and assistance\
in those men who in the beginning of their rule were distrusted than\
among those who in the beginning were trusted. Pandolfo Petrucci, Prince\
of Siena, ruled his state more by those who had been distrusted than by\
others. But on this question one cannot speak generally, for it varies\
so much with the individual; I will only say this, that those men who\
at the commencement of a princedom have been hostile, if they are of\
a description to need assistance to support themselves, can always be\
gained over with the greatest ease, and they will be tightly held to\
serve the prince with fidelity, inasmuch as they know it to be very\
necessary for them to cancel by deeds the bad impression which he had\
formed of them; and thus the prince always extracts more profit from\
them than from those who, serving him in too much security, may neglect\
his affairs. And since the matter demands it, I must not fail to warn a\
prince, who by means of secret favours has acquired a new state, that he\
must well consider the reasons which induced those to favour him who\
did so; and if it be not a natural affection towards him, but only\
discontent with their government, then he will only keep them friendly\
with great trouble and difficulty, for it will be impossible to satisfy\
them. And weighing well the reasons for this in those examples which\
can be taken from ancient and modern affairs, we shall find that it is\
easier for the prince to make friends of those men who were contented\
under the former government, and are therefore his enemies, than of\
those who, being discontented with it, were favourable to him and\
encouraged him to seize it.\
\
6. It has been a custom with princes, in order to hold their states\
more securely, to build fortresses that may serve as a bridle and bit\
to those who might design to work against them, and as a place of refuge\
from a first attack. I praise this system because it has been made use\
of formerly. Notwithstanding that, Messer Nicolo Vitelli in our times\
has been seen to demolish two fortresses in Citta di Castello so that he\
might keep that state; Guido Ubaldo, Duke of Urbino, on returning to\
his dominion, whence he had been driven by Cesare Borgia, razed to the\
foundations all the fortresses in that province, and considered that\
without them it would be more difficult to lose it; the Bentivogli\
returning to Bologna came to a similar decision. Fortresses, therefore,\
are useful or not according to circumstances; if they do you good in one\
way they injure you in another. And this question can be reasoned thus:\
the prince who has more to fear from the people than from foreigners\
ought to build fortresses, but he who has more to fear from foreigners\
than from the people ought to leave them alone. The castle of Milan,\
built by Francesco Sforza, has made, and will make, more trouble for the\
house of Sforza than any other disorder in the state. For this reason\
the best possible fortress is--not to be hated by the people, because,\
although you may hold the fortresses, yet they will not save you if the\
people hate you, for there will never be wanting foreigners to assist\
a people who have taken arms against you. It has not been seen in our\
times that such fortresses have been of use to any prince, unless to the\
Countess of Forli,(*) when the Count Girolamo, her consort, was killed;\
for by that means she was able to withstand the popular attack and wait\
for assistance from Milan, and thus recover her state; and the posture\
of affairs was such at that time that the foreigners could not assist\
the people. But fortresses were of little value to her afterwards when\
Cesare Borgia attacked her, and when the people, her enemy, were allied\
with foreigners. Therefore, it would have been safer for her, both then\
and before, not to have been hated by the people than to have had the\
fortresses. All these things considered then, I shall praise him\
who builds fortresses as well as him who does not, and I shall blame\
whoever, trusting in them, cares little about being hated by the people.\
\
     (*) Catherine Sforza, a daughter of Galeazzo Sforza and\
     Lucrezia Landriani, born 1463, died 1509. It was to the\
     Countess of Forli that Machiavelli was sent as envy on 1499.\
     A letter from Fortunati to the countess announces the\
     appointment: "I have been with the signori," wrote\
     Fortunati, "to learn whom they would send and when. They\
     tell me that Nicolo Machiavelli, a learned young Florentine\
     noble, secretary to my Lords of the Ten, is to leave with me\
     at once." Cf. "Catherine Sforza," by Count Pasolini,\
     translated by P. Sylvester, 1898.\

\
CHAPTER XXI -- HOW A PRINCE SHOULD CONDUCT HIMSELF SO AS TO GAIN RENOWN\
\
Nothing makes a prince so much esteemed as great enterprises and setting\
a fine example. We have in our time Ferdinand of Aragon, the present\
King of Spain. He can almost be called a new prince, because he has\
risen, by fame and glory, from being an insignificant king to be the\
foremost king in Christendom; and if you will consider his deeds\
you will find them all great and some of them extraordinary. In the\
beginning of his reign he attacked Granada, and this enterprise was the\
foundation of his dominions. He did this quietly at first and without\
any fear of hindrance, for he held the minds of the barons of Castile\
occupied in thinking of the war and not anticipating any innovations;\
thus they did not perceive that by these means he was acquiring power\
and authority over them. He was able with the money of the Church and\
of the people to sustain his armies, and by that long war to lay the\
foundation for the military skill which has since distinguished him.\
Further, always using religion as a plea, so as to undertake greater\
schemes, he devoted himself with pious cruelty to driving out and\
clearing his kingdom of the Moors; nor could there be a more admirable\
example, nor one more rare. Under this same cloak he assailed Africa,\
he came down on Italy, he has finally attacked France; and thus his\
achievements and designs have always been great, and have kept the minds\
of his people in suspense and admiration and occupied with the issue of\
them. And his actions have arisen in such a way, one out of the other,\
that men have never been given time to work steadily against him.\
\
Again, it much assists a prince to set unusual examples in internal\
affairs, similar to those which are related of Messer Bernabo da Milano,\
who, when he had the opportunity, by any one in civil life doing some\
extraordinary thing, either good or bad, would take some method of\
rewarding or punishing him, which would be much spoken about. And a\
prince ought, above all things, always endeavour in every action to gain\
for himself the reputation of being a great and remarkable man.\
\
A prince is also respected when he is either a true friend or a\
downright enemy, that is to say, when, without any reservation, he\
declares himself in favour of one party against the other; which course\
will always be more advantageous than standing neutral; because if two\
of your powerful neighbours come to blows, they are of such a character\
that, if one of them conquers, you have either to fear him or not.\
In either case it will always be more advantageous for you to declare\
yourself and to make war strenuously; because, in the first case, if\
you do not declare yourself, you will invariably fall a prey to\
the conqueror, to the pleasure and satisfaction of him who has been\
conquered, and you will have no reasons to offer, nor anything to\
protect or to shelter you. Because he who conquers does not want\
doubtful friends who will not aid him in the time of trial; and he who\
loses will not harbour you because you did not willingly, sword in hand,\
court his fate.\
\
Antiochus went into Greece, being sent for by the Aetolians to drive\
out the Romans. He sent envoys to the Achaeans, who were friends of\
the Romans, exhorting them to remain neutral; and on the other hand the\
Romans urged them to take up arms. This question came to be discussed in\
the council of the Achaeans, where the legate of Antiochus urged them to\
stand neutral. To this the Roman legate answered: "As for that which has\
been said, that it is better and more advantageous for your state not\
to interfere in our war, nothing can be more erroneous; because by\
not interfering you will be left, without favour or consideration, the\
guerdon of the conqueror." Thus it will always happen that he who is not\
your friend will demand your neutrality, whilst he who is your friend\
will entreat you to declare yourself with arms. And irresolute princes,\
to avoid present dangers, generally follow the neutral path, and are\
generally ruined. But when a prince declares himself gallantly in favour\
of one side, if the party with whom he allies himself conquers, although\
the victor may be powerful and may have him at his mercy, yet he is\
indebted to him, and there is established a bond of amity; and men are\
never so shameless as to become a monument of ingratitude by oppressing\
you. Victories after all are never so complete that the victor must not\
show some regard, especially to justice. But if he with whom you ally\
yourself loses, you may be sheltered by him, and whilst he is able he\
may aid you, and you become companions on a fortune that may rise again.\
\
In the second case, when those who fight are of such a character that\
you have no anxiety as to who may conquer, so much the more is it\
greater prudence to be allied, because you assist at the destruction\
of one by the aid of another who, if he had been wise, would have saved\
him; and conquering, as it is impossible that he should not do with your\
assistance, he remains at your discretion. And here it is to be noted\
that a prince ought to take care never to make an alliance with one\
more powerful than himself for the purposes of attacking others, unless\
necessity compels him, as is said above; because if he conquers you are\
at his discretion, and princes ought to avoid as much as possible being\
at the discretion of any one. The Venetians joined with France against\
the Duke of Milan, and this alliance, which caused their ruin, could\
have been avoided. But when it cannot be avoided, as happened to the\
Florentines when the Pope and Spain sent armies to attack Lombardy, then\
in such a case, for the above reasons, the prince ought to favour one of\
the parties.\
\
Never let any Government imagine that it can choose perfectly safe\
courses; rather let it expect to have to take very doubtful ones,\
because it is found in ordinary affairs that one never seeks to avoid\
one trouble without running into another; but prudence consists in\
knowing how to distinguish the character of troubles, and for choice to\
take the lesser evil.\
\
A prince ought also to show himself a patron of ability, and to honour\
the proficient in every art. At the same time he should encourage his\
citizens to practise their callings peaceably, both in commerce and\
agriculture, and in every other following, so that the one should not be\
deterred from improving his possessions for fear lest they be taken away\
from him or another from opening up trade for fear of taxes; but the\
prince ought to offer rewards to whoever wishes to do these things and\
designs in any way to honour his city or state.\
\
Further, he ought to entertain the people with festivals and spectacles\
at convenient seasons of the year; and as every city is divided into\
guilds or into societies,(*) he ought to hold such bodies in esteem, and\
associate with them sometimes, and show himself an example of courtesy\
and liberality; nevertheless, always maintaining the majesty of his\
rank, for this he must never consent to abate in anything.\
\
     (*) "Guilds or societies," "in arti o in tribu." "Arti" were\
     craft or trade guilds, cf. Florio: "Arte . . . a whole\
     company of any trade in any city or corporation town." The\
     guilds of Florence are most admirably described by Mr\
     Edgcumbe Staley in his work on the subject (Methuen, 1906).\
     Institutions of a somewhat similar character, called\
     "artel," exist in Russia to-day, cf. Sir Mackenzie Wallace's\
     "Russia," ed. 1905: "The sons . . . were always during the\
     working season members of an artel. In some of the larger\
     towns there are artels of a much more complex kind--\
     permanent associations, possessing large capital, and\
     pecuniarily responsible for the acts of the individual\
     members." The word "artel," despite its apparent similarity,\
     has, Mr Aylmer Maude assures me, no connection with "ars" or\
     "arte." Its root is that of the verb "rotisya," to bind\
     oneself by an oath; and it is generally admitted to be only\
     another form of "rota," which now signifies a "regimental\
     company." In both words the underlying idea is that of a\
     body of men united by an oath. "Tribu" were possibly gentile\
     groups, united by common descent, and included individuals\
     connected by marriage. Perhaps our words "sects" or "clans"\
     would be most appropriate.\

CHAPTER XXII -- CONCERNING THE SECRETARIES OF PRINCES\
\
The choice of servants is of no little importance to a prince, and they\
are good or not according to the discrimination of the prince. And the\
first opinion which one forms of a prince, and of his understanding, is\
by observing the men he has around him; and when they are capable and\
faithful he may always be considered wise, because he has known how\
to recognize the capable and to keep them faithful. But when they are\
otherwise one cannot form a good opinion of him, for the prime error\
which he made was in choosing them.\
\
There were none who knew Messer Antonio da Venafro as the servant of\
Pandolfo Petrucci, Prince of Siena, who would not consider Pandolfo to\
be a very clever man in having Venafro for his servant. Because there\
are three classes of intellects: one which comprehends by itself;\
another which appreciates what others comprehended; and a third which\
neither comprehends by itself nor by the showing of others; the first is\
the most excellent, the second is good, the third is useless. Therefore,\
it follows necessarily that, if Pandolfo was not in the first rank, he\
was in the second, for whenever one has judgment to know good and\
bad when it is said and done, although he himself may not have the\
initiative, yet he can recognize the good and the bad in his servant,\
and the one he can praise and the other correct; thus the servant cannot\
hope to deceive him, and is kept honest.\
\
But to enable a prince to form an opinion of his servant there is one\
test which never fails; when you see the servant thinking more of his\
own interests than of yours, and seeking inwardly his own profit in\
everything, such a man will never make a good servant, nor will you ever\
be able to trust him; because he who has the state of another in his\
hands ought never to think of himself, but always of his prince, and\
never pay any attention to matters in which the prince is not concerned.\
\
On the other hand, to keep his servant honest the prince ought to study\
him, honouring him, enriching him, doing him kindnesses, sharing with\
him the honours and cares; and at the same time let him see that he\
cannot stand alone, so that many honours may not make him desire more,\
many riches make him wish for more, and that many cares may make him\
dread chances. When, therefore, servants, and princes towards servants,\
are thus disposed, they can trust each other, but when it is otherwise,\
the end will always be disastrous for either one or the other.\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XXIII -- HOW FLATTERERS SHOULD BE AVOIDED\
\
I do not wish to leave out an important branch of this subject, for it\
is a danger from which princes are with difficulty preserved, unless\
they are very careful and discriminating. It is that of flatterers, of\
whom courts are full, because men are so self-complacent in their own\
affairs, and in a way so deceived in them, that they are preserved with\
difficulty from this pest, and if they wish to defend themselves they\
run the danger of falling into contempt. Because there is no other way\
of guarding oneself from flatterers except letting men understand that\
to tell you the truth does not offend you; but when every one may tell\
you the truth, respect for you abates.\
\
Therefore a wise prince ought to hold a third course by choosing the\
wise men in his state, and giving to them only the liberty of speaking\
the truth to him, and then only of those things of which he inquires,\
and of none others; but he ought to question them upon everything, and\
listen to their opinions, and afterwards form his own conclusions.\
With these councillors, separately and collectively, he ought to carry\
himself in such a way that each of them should know that, the more\
freely he shall speak, the more he shall be preferred; outside of\
these, he should listen to no one, pursue the thing resolved on, and be\
steadfast in his resolutions. He who does otherwise is either overthrown\
by flatterers, or is so often changed by varying opinions that he falls\
into contempt.\
\
I wish on this subject to adduce a modern example. Fra Luca, the man of\
affairs to Maximilian,(*) the present emperor, speaking of his majesty,\
said: He consulted with no one, yet never got his own way in anything.\
This arose because of his following a practice the opposite to the\
above; for the emperor is a secretive man--he does not communicate his\
designs to any one, nor does he receive opinions on them. But as in\
carrying them into effect they become revealed and known, they are\
at once obstructed by those men whom he has around him, and he, being\
pliant, is diverted from them. Hence it follows that those things he\
does one day he undoes the next, and no one ever understands what he\
wishes or intends to do, and no one can rely on his resolutions.\
\
     (*) Maximilian I, born in 1459, died 1519, Emperor of the\
     Holy Roman Empire. He married, first, Mary, daughter of\
     Charles the Bold; after her death, Bianca Sforza; and thus\
     became involved in Italian politics.\
\
A prince, therefore, ought always to take counsel, but only when he\
wishes and not when others wish; he ought rather to discourage every one\
from offering advice unless he asks it; but, however, he ought to be\
a constant inquirer, and afterwards a patient listener concerning the\
things of which he inquired; also, on learning that any one, on any\
consideration, has not told him the truth, he should let his anger be\
felt.\
\
And if there are some who think that a prince who conveys an impression\
of his wisdom is not so through his own ability, but through the good\
advisers that he has around him, beyond doubt they are deceived, because\
this is an axiom which never fails: that a prince who is not wise\
himself will never take good advice, unless by chance he has yielded his\
affairs entirely to one person who happens to be a very prudent man. In\
this case indeed he may be well governed, but it would not be for long,\
because such a governor would in a short time take away his state from\
him.\
\
But if a prince who is not inexperienced should take counsel from more\
than one he will never get united counsels, nor will he know how to\
unite them. Each of the counsellors will think of his own interests, and\
the prince will not know how to control them or to see through them. And\
they are not to found otherwise, because men will always prove untrue\
to you unless they are kept honest by constraint. Therefore it must be\
inferred that good counsels, whencesoever they come, are born of\
the wisdom of the prince, and not the wisdom of the prince from good\
counsels.\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XXIV -- WHY THE PRINCES OF ITALY HAVE LOST THEIR STATES\
\
The previous suggestions, carefully observed, will enable a new prince\
to appear well established, and render him at once more secure and fixed\
in the state than if he had been long seated there. For the actions of\
a new prince are more narrowly observed than those of an hereditary\
one, and when they are seen to be able they gain more men and bind\
far tighter than ancient blood; because men are attracted more by the\
present than by the past, and when they find the present good they enjoy\
it and seek no further; they will also make the utmost defence of a\
prince if he fails them not in other things. Thus it will be a double\
glory for him to have established a new principality, and adorned and\
strengthened it with good laws, good arms, good allies, and with a good\
example; so will it be a double disgrace to him who, born a prince,\
shall lose his state by want of wisdom.\
\
And if those seigniors are considered who have lost their states in\
Italy in our times, such as the King of Naples, the Duke of Milan,\
and others, there will be found in them, firstly, one common defect in\
regard to arms from the causes which have been discussed at length; in\
the next place, some one of them will be seen, either to have had the\
people hostile, or if he has had the people friendly, he has not known\
how to secure the nobles. In the absence of these defects states that\
have power enough to keep an army in the field cannot be lost.\
\
Philip of Macedon, not the father of Alexander the Great, but he who\
was conquered by Titus Quintius, had not much territory compared to\
the greatness of the Romans and of Greece who attacked him, yet being a\
warlike man who knew how to attract the people and secure the nobles, he\
sustained the war against his enemies for many years, and if in the\
end he lost the dominion of some cities, nevertheless he retained the\
kingdom.\
\
Therefore, do not let our princes accuse fortune for the loss of their\
principalities after so many years' possession, but rather their own\
sloth, because in quiet times they never thought there could be a change\
(it is a common defect in man not to make any provision in the calm\
against the tempest), and when afterwards the bad times came they\
thought of flight and not of defending themselves, and they hoped that\
the people, disgusted with the insolence of the conquerors, would recall\
them. This course, when others fail, may be good, but it is very bad to\
have neglected all other expedients for that, since you would never\
wish to fall because you trusted to be able to find someone later on to\
restore you. This again either does not happen, or, if it does, it will\
not be for your security, because that deliverance is of no avail which\
does not depend upon yourself; those only are reliable, certain, and\
durable that depend on yourself and your valour.\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XXV -- WHAT FORTUNE CAN EFFECT IN HUMAN AFFAIRS AND HOW TO\
WITHSTAND HER\
\
It is not unknown to me how many men have had, and still have, the\
opinion that the affairs of the world are in such wise governed by\
fortune and by God that men with their wisdom cannot direct them and\
that no one can even help them; and because of this they would have us\
believe that it is not necessary to labour much in affairs, but to let\
chance govern them. This opinion has been more credited in our times\
because of the great changes in affairs which have been seen, and\
may still be seen, every day, beyond all human conjecture. Sometimes\
pondering over this, I am in some degree inclined to their opinion.\
Nevertheless, not to extinguish our free will, I hold it to be true that\
Fortune is the arbiter of one-half of our actions,(*) but that she still\
leaves us to direct the other half, or perhaps a little less.\
\
     (*) Frederick the Great was accustomed to say: "The older\
     one gets the more convinced one becomes that his Majesty\
     King Chance does three-quarters of the business of this\
     miserable universe." Sorel's "Eastern Question."\
\
I compare her to one of those raging rivers, which when in flood\
overflows the plains, sweeping away trees and buildings, bearing away\
the soil from place to place; everything flies before it, all yield to\
its violence, without being able in any way to withstand it; and yet,\
though its nature be such, it does not follow therefore that men, when\
the weather becomes fair, shall not make provision, both with defences\
and barriers, in such a manner that, rising again, the waters may\
pass away by canal, and their force be neither so unrestrained nor so\
dangerous. So it happens with fortune, who shows her power where valour\
has not prepared to resist her, and thither she turns her forces where\
she knows that barriers and defences have not been raised to constrain\
her.\
\
And if you will consider Italy, which is the seat of these changes, and\
which has given to them their impulse, you will see it to be an open\
country without barriers and without any defence. For if it had been\
defended by proper valour, as are Germany, Spain, and France, either\
this invasion would not have made the great changes it has made or it\
would not have come at all. And this I consider enough to say concerning\
resistance to fortune in general.\
\
But confining myself more to the particular, I say that a prince may be\
seen happy to-day and ruined to-morrow without having shown any change\
of disposition or character. This, I believe, arises firstly from causes\
that have already been discussed at length, namely, that the prince who\
relies entirely on fortune is lost when it changes. I believe also that\
he will be successful who directs his actions according to the spirit of\
the times, and that he whose actions do not accord with the times will\
not be successful. Because men are seen, in affairs that lead to the end\
which every man has before him, namely, glory and riches, to get there\
by various methods; one with caution, another with haste; one by force,\
another by skill; one by patience, another by its opposite; and each one\
succeeds in reaching the goal by a different method. One can also see of\
two cautious men the one attain his end, the other fail; and similarly,\
two men by different observances are equally successful, the one being\
cautious, the other impetuous; all this arises from nothing else than\
whether or not they conform in their methods to the spirit of the times.\
This follows from what I have said, that two men working differently\
bring about the same effect, and of two working similarly, one attains\
his object and the other does not.\
\
Changes in estate also issue from this, for if, to one who governs\
himself with caution and patience, times and affairs converge in such a\
way that his administration is successful, his fortune is made; but if\
times and affairs change, he is ruined if he does not change his course\
of action. But a man is not often found sufficiently circumspect to know\
how to accommodate himself to the change, both because he cannot deviate\
from what nature inclines him to do, and also because, having always\
prospered by acting in one way, he cannot be persuaded that it is well\
to leave it; and, therefore, the cautious man, when it is time to turn\
adventurous, does not know how to do it, hence he is ruined; but had he\
changed his conduct with the times fortune would not have changed.\
\
Pope Julius the Second went to work impetuously in all his affairs, and\
found the times and circumstances conform so well to that line of action\
that he always met with success. Consider his first enterprise against\
Bologna, Messer Giovanni Bentivogli being still alive. The Venetians\
were not agreeable to it, nor was the King of Spain, and he had the\
enterprise still under discussion with the King of France; nevertheless\
he personally entered upon the expedition with his accustomed boldness\
and energy, a move which made Spain and the Venetians stand irresolute\
and passive, the latter from fear, the former from desire to recover\
the kingdom of Naples; on the other hand, he drew after him the King of\
France, because that king, having observed the movement, and desiring\
to make the Pope his friend so as to humble the Venetians, found it\
impossible to refuse him. Therefore Julius with his impetuous action\
accomplished what no other pontiff with simple human wisdom could have\
done; for if he had waited in Rome until he could get away, with his\
plans arranged and everything fixed, as any other pontiff would have\
done, he would never have succeeded. Because the King of France would\
have made a thousand excuses, and the others would have raised a\
thousand fears.\
\
I will leave his other actions alone, as they were all alike, and they\
all succeeded, for the shortness of his life did not let him experience\
the contrary; but if circumstances had arisen which required him to go\
cautiously, his ruin would have followed, because he would never have\
deviated from those ways to which nature inclined him.\
\
I conclude, therefore that, fortune being changeful and mankind\
steadfast in their ways, so long as the two are in agreement men are\
successful, but unsuccessful when they fall out. For my part I consider\
that it is better to be adventurous than cautious, because fortune is\
a woman, and if you wish to keep her under it is necessary to beat and\
ill-use her; and it is seen that she allows herself to be mastered by\
the adventurous rather than by those who go to work more coldly. She is,\
therefore, always, woman-like, a lover of young men, because they are\
less cautious, more violent, and with more audacity command her.\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XXVI -- AN EXHORTATION TO LIBERATE ITALY FROM THE BARBARIANS\
\
Having carefully considered the subject of the above discourses, and\
wondering within myself whether the present times were propitious to\
a new prince, and whether there were elements that would give an\
opportunity to a wise and virtuous one to introduce a new order of\
things which would do honour to him and good to the people of this\
country, it appears to me that so many things concur to favour a new\
prince that I never knew a time more fit than the present.\
\
And if, as I said, it was necessary that the people of Israel should be\
captive so as to make manifest the ability of Moses; that the Persians\
should be oppressed by the Medes so as to discover the greatness of the\
soul of Cyrus; and that the Athenians should be dispersed to illustrate\
the capabilities of Theseus: then at the present time, in order to\
discover the virtue of an Italian spirit, it was necessary that Italy\
should be reduced to the extremity that she is now in, that she should\
be more enslaved than the Hebrews, more oppressed than the Persians,\
more scattered than the Athenians; without head, without order, beaten,\
despoiled, torn, overrun; and to have endured every kind of desolation.\
\
Although lately some spark may have been shown by one, which made us\
think he was ordained by God for our redemption, nevertheless it was\
afterwards seen, in the height of his career, that fortune rejected him;\
so that Italy, left as without life, waits for him who shall yet heal\
her wounds and put an end to the ravaging and plundering of Lombardy,\
to the swindling and taxing of the kingdom and of Tuscany, and cleanse\
those sores that for long have festered. It is seen how she entreats God\
to send someone who shall deliver her from these wrongs and barbarous\
insolencies. It is seen also that she is ready and willing to follow a\
banner if only someone will raise it.\
\
Nor is there to be seen at present one in whom she can place more hope\
than in your illustrious house,(*) with its valour and fortune, favoured\
by God and by the Church of which it is now the chief, and which could\
be made the head of this redemption. This will not be difficult if you\
will recall to yourself the actions and lives of the men I have named.\
And although they were great and wonderful men, yet they were men, and\
each one of them had no more opportunity than the present offers, for\
their enterprises were neither more just nor easier than this, nor was\
God more their friend than He is yours.\
\
     (*) Giuliano de Medici. He had just been created a cardinal\
     by Leo X. In 1523 Giuliano was elected Pope, and took the\
     title of Clement VII.\
\
With us there is great justice, because that war is just which is\
necessary, and arms are hallowed when there is no other hope but in\
them. Here there is the greatest willingness, and where the willingness\
is great the difficulties cannot be great if you will only follow those\
men to whom I have directed your attention. Further than this, how\
extraordinarily the ways of God have been manifested beyond example:\
the sea is divided, a cloud has led the way, the rock has poured\
forth water, it has rained manna, everything has contributed to\
your greatness; you ought to do the rest. God is not willing to do\
everything, and thus take away our free will and that share of glory\
which belongs to us.\
\
And it is not to be wondered at if none of the above-named Italians\
have been able to accomplish all that is expected from your illustrious\
house; and if in so many revolutions in Italy, and in so many campaigns,\
it has always appeared as if military virtue were exhausted, this has\
happened because the old order of things was not good, and none of us\
have known how to find a new one. And nothing honours a man more than to\
establish new laws and new ordinances when he himself was newly risen.\
Such things when they are well founded and dignified will make him\
revered and admired, and in Italy there are not wanting opportunities to\
bring such into use in every form.\
\
Here there is great valour in the limbs whilst it fails in the head.\
Look attentively at the duels and the hand-to-hand combats, how superior\
the Italians are in strength, dexterity, and subtlety. But when it comes\
to armies they do not bear comparison, and this springs entirely from\
the insufficiency of the leaders, since those who are capable are not\
obedient, and each one seems to himself to know, there having never been\
any one so distinguished above the rest, either by valour or fortune,\
that others would yield to him. Hence it is that for so long a time,\
and during so much fighting in the past twenty years, whenever there\
has been an army wholly Italian, it has always given a poor account of\
itself; the first witness to this is Il Taro, afterwards Allesandria,\
Capua, Genoa, Vaila, Bologna, Mestri.(*)\
\
     (*) The battles of Il Taro, 1495; Alessandria, 1499; Capua,\
     1501; Genoa, 1507; Vaila, 1509; Bologna, 1511; Mestri, 1513.\
\
If, therefore, your illustrious house wishes to follow these remarkable\
men who have redeemed their country, it is necessary before all things,\
as a true foundation for every enterprise, to be provided with your\
own forces, because there can be no more faithful, truer, or better\
soldiers. And although singly they are good, altogether they will\
be much better when they find themselves commanded by their prince,\
honoured by him, and maintained at his expense. Therefore it is\
necessary to be prepared with such arms, so that you can be defended\
against foreigners by Italian valour.\
\
And although Swiss and Spanish infantry may be considered very\
formidable, nevertheless there is a defect in both, by reason of which\
a third order would not only be able to oppose them, but might be relied\
upon to overthrow them. For the Spaniards cannot resist cavalry, and the\
Switzers are afraid of infantry whenever they encounter them in close\
combat. Owing to this, as has been and may again be seen, the Spaniards\
are unable to resist French cavalry, and the Switzers are overthrown by\
Spanish infantry. And although a complete proof of this latter cannot\
be shown, nevertheless there was some evidence of it at the battle of\
Ravenna, when the Spanish infantry were confronted by German battalions,\
who follow the same tactics as the Swiss; when the Spaniards, by agility\
of body and with the aid of their shields, got in under the pikes of the\
Germans and stood out of danger, able to attack, while the Germans stood\
helpless, and, if the cavalry had not dashed up, all would have been\
over with them. It is possible, therefore, knowing the defects of both\
these infantries, to invent a new one, which will resist cavalry and not\
be afraid of infantry; this need not create a new order of arms, but\
a variation upon the old. And these are the kind of improvements which\
confer reputation and power upon a new prince.\
\
This opportunity, therefore, ought not to be allowed to pass for letting\
Italy at last see her liberator appear. Nor can one express the love\
with which he would be received in all those provinces which have\
suffered so much from these foreign scourings, with what thirst for\
revenge, with what stubborn faith, with what devotion, with what tears.\
What door would be closed to him? Who would refuse obedience to him?\
What envy would hinder him? What Italian would refuse him homage? To all\
of us this barbarous dominion stinks. Let, therefore, your illustrious\
house take up this charge with that courage and hope with which all\
just enterprises are undertaken, so that under its standard our native\
country may be ennobled, and under its auspices may be verified that\
saying of Petrarch:\
\
     Virtu contro al Furore\
     Prendera l'arme, e fia il combatter corto:\
     Che l'antico valore\
     Negli italici cuor non e ancor morto.\
\
     Virtue against fury shall advance the fight,\
     And it i' th' combat soon shall put to flight:\
     For the old Roman valour is not dead,\
     Nor in th' Italians' brests extinguished.\

\
DESCRIPTION OF THE METHODS ADOPTED BY THE DUKE VALENTINO WHEN MURDERING\
VITELLOZZO VITELLI, OLIVEROTTO DA FERMO, THE SIGNOR PAGOLO, AND THE DUKE\
DI GRAVINA ORSINI\
\
BY\
\
NICOLO MACHIAVELLI\
\
\
The Duke Valentino had returned from Lombardy, where he had been to\
clear himself with the King of France from the calumnies which had been\
raised against him by the Florentines concerning the rebellion of Arezzo\
and other towns in the Val di Chiana, and had arrived at Imola, whence\
he intended with his army to enter upon the campaign against Giovanni\
Bentivogli, the tyrant of Bologna: for he intended to bring that city\
under his domination, and to make it the head of his Romagnian duchy.\
\
These matters coming to the knowledge of the Vitelli and Orsini and\
their following, it appeared to them that the duke would become too\
powerful, and it was feared that, having seized Bologna, he would seek\
to destroy them in order that he might become supreme in Italy. Upon\
this a meeting was called at Magione in the district of Perugia,\
to which came the cardinal, Pagolo, and the Duke di Gravina Orsini,\
Vitellozzo Vitelli, Oliverotto da Fermo, Gianpagolo Baglioni, the tyrant\
of Perugia, and Messer Antonio da Venafro, sent by Pandolfo Petrucci,\
the Prince of Siena. Here were discussed the power and courage of the\
duke and the necessity of curbing his ambitions, which might otherwise\
bring danger to the rest of being ruined. And they decided not to\
abandon the Bentivogli, but to strive to win over the Florentines; and\
they send their men to one place and another, promising to one party\
assistance and to another encouragement to unite with them against the\
common enemy. This meeting was at once reported throughout all Italy,\
and those who were discontented under the duke, among whom were the\
people of Urbino, took hope of effecting a revolution.\
\
Thus it arose that, men's minds being thus unsettled, it was decided by\
certain men of Urbino to seize the fortress of San Leo, which was\
held for the duke, and which they captured by the following means. The\
castellan was fortifying the rock and causing timber to be taken there;\
so the conspirators watched, and when certain beams which were being\
carried to the rock were upon the bridge, so that it was prevented from\
being drawn up by those inside, they took the opportunity of leaping\
upon the bridge and thence into the fortress. Upon this capture being\
effected, the whole state rebelled and recalled the old duke, being\
encouraged in this, not so much by the capture of the fort, as by the\
Diet at Magione, from whom they expected to get assistance.\
\
Those who heard of the rebellion at Urbino thought they would not lose\
the opportunity, and at once assembled their men so as to take any town,\
should any remain in the hands of the duke in that state; and they sent\
again to Florence to beg that republic to join with them in destroying\
the common firebrand, showing that the risk was lessened and that they\
ought not to wait for another opportunity.\
\
But the Florentines, from hatred, for sundry reasons, of the Vitelli and\
Orsini, not only would not ally themselves, but sent Nicolo Machiavelli,\
their secretary, to offer shelter and assistance to the duke against\
his enemies. The duke was found full of fear at Imola, because, against\
everybody's expectation, his soldiers had at once gone over to the\
enemy and he found himself disarmed and war at his door. But recovering\
courage from the offers of the Florentines, he decided to temporize\
before fighting with the few soldiers that remained to him, and to\
negotiate for a reconciliation, and also to get assistance. This latter\
he obtained in two ways, by sending to the King of France for men and by\
enlisting men-at-arms and others whom he turned into cavalry of a sort:\
to all he gave money.\
\
Notwithstanding this, his enemies drew near to him, and approached\
Fossombrone, where they encountered some men of the duke and, with the\
aid of the Orsini and Vitelli, routed them. When this happened, the duke\
resolved at once to see if he could not close the trouble with offers of\
reconciliation, and being a most perfect dissembler he did not fail in\
any practices to make the insurgents understand that he wished every man\
who had acquired anything to keep it, as it was enough for him to have\
the title of prince, whilst others might have the principality.\
\
And the duke succeeded so well in this that they sent Signor Pagolo to\
him to negotiate for a reconciliation, and they brought their army to a\
standstill. But the duke did not stop his preparations, and took\
every care to provide himself with cavalry and infantry, and that such\
preparations might not be apparent to the others, he sent his troops in\
separate parties to every part of the Romagna. In the meanwhile there\
came also to him five hundred French lancers, and although he found\
himself sufficiently strong to take vengeance on his enemies in open\
war, he considered that it would be safer and more advantageous\
to outwit them, and for this reason he did not stop the work of\
reconciliation.\
\
And that this might be effected the duke concluded a peace with them in\
which he confirmed their former covenants; he gave them four thousand\
ducats at once; he promised not to injure the Bentivogli; and he formed\
an alliance with Giovanni; and moreover he would not force them to come\
personally into his presence unless it pleased them to do so. On the\
other hand, they promised to restore to him the duchy of Urbino and\
other places seized by them, to serve him in all his expeditions, and\
not to make war against or ally themselves with any one without his\
permission.\
\
This reconciliation being completed, Guido Ubaldo, the Duke of Urbino,\
again fled to Venice, having first destroyed all the fortresses in\
his state; because, trusting in the people, he did not wish that the\
fortresses, which he did not think he could defend, should be held by\
the enemy, since by these means a check would be kept upon his friends.\
But the Duke Valentino, having completed this convention, and dispersed\
his men throughout the Romagna, set out for Imola at the end of November\
together with his French men-at-arms: thence he went to Cesena, where he\
stayed some time to negotiate with the envoys of the Vitelli and Orsini,\
who had assembled with their men in the duchy of Urbino, as to the\
enterprise in which they should now take part; but nothing being\
concluded, Oliverotto da Fermo was sent to propose that if the duke\
wished to undertake an expedition against Tuscany they were ready; if\
he did not wish it, then they would besiege Sinigalia. To this the duke\
replied that he did not wish to enter into war with Tuscany, and thus\
become hostile to the Florentines, but that he was very willing to\
proceed against Sinigalia.\
\
It happened that not long afterwards the town surrendered, but the\
fortress would not yield to them because the castellan would not give\
it up to any one but the duke in person; therefore they exhorted him\
to come there. This appeared a good opportunity to the duke, as, being\
invited by them, and not going of his own will, he would awaken no\
suspicions. And the more to reassure them, he allowed all the French\
men-at-arms who were with him in Lombardy to depart, except the hundred\
lancers under Mons. di Candales, his brother-in-law. He left Cesena\
about the middle of December, and went to Fano, and with the utmost\
cunning and cleverness he persuaded the Vitelli and Orsini to wait for\
him at Sinigalia, pointing out to them that any lack of compliance would\
cast a doubt upon the sincerity and permanency of the reconciliation,\
and that he was a man who wished to make use of the arms and councils of\
his friends. But Vitellozzo remained very stubborn, for the death of\
his brother warned him that he should not offend a prince and afterwards\
trust him; nevertheless, persuaded by Pagolo Orsini, whom the duke had\
corrupted with gifts and promises, he agreed to wait.\
\
Upon this the duke, before his departure from Fano, which was to be\
on 30th December 1502, communicated his designs to eight of his most\
trusted followers, among whom were Don Michele and the Monsignor d'Euna,\
who was afterwards cardinal; and he ordered that, as soon as Vitellozzo,\
Pagolo Orsini, the Duke di Gravina, and Oliverotto should arrive, his\
followers in pairs should take them one by one, entrusting certain\
men to certain pairs, who should entertain them until they reached\
Sinigalia; nor should they be permitted to leave until they came to the\
duke's quarters, where they should be seized.\
\
The duke afterwards ordered all his horsemen and infantry, of which\
there were more than two thousand cavalry and ten thousand footmen, to\
assemble by daybreak at the Metauro, a river five miles distant from\
Fano, and await him there. He found himself, therefore, on the last day\
of December at the Metauro with his men, and having sent a cavalcade\
of about two hundred horsemen before him, he then moved forward the\
infantry, whom he accompanied with the rest of the men-at-arms.\
\
Fano and Sinigalia are two cities of La Marca situate on the shore of\
the Adriatic Sea, fifteen miles distant from each other, so that he who\
goes towards Sinigalia has the mountains on his right hand, the bases\
of which are touched by the sea in some places. The city of Sinigalia is\
distant from the foot of the mountains a little more than a bow-shot\
and from the shore about a mile. On the side opposite to the city runs\
a little river which bathes that part of the walls looking towards Fano,\
facing the high road. Thus he who draws near to Sinigalia comes for\
a good space by road along the mountains, and reaches the river which\
passes by Sinigalia. If he turns to his left hand along the bank of it,\
and goes for the distance of a bow-shot, he arrives at a bridge which\
crosses the river; he is then almost abreast of the gate that leads into\
Sinigalia, not by a straight line, but transversely. Before this gate\
there stands a collection of houses with a square to which the bank of\
the river forms one side.\
\
The Vitelli and Orsini having received orders to wait for the duke, and\
to honour him in person, sent away their men to several castles distant\
from Sinigalia about six miles, so that room could be made for the men\
of the duke; and they left in Sinigalia only Oliverotto and his band,\
which consisted of one thousand infantry and one hundred and fifty\
horsemen, who were quartered in the suburb mentioned above. Matters\
having been thus arranged, the Duke Valentino left for Sinigalia, and\
when the leaders of the cavalry reached the bridge they did not pass\
over, but having opened it, one portion wheeled towards the river and\
the other towards the country, and a way was left in the middle through\
which the infantry passed, without stopping, into the town.\
\
Vitellozzo, Pagolo, and the Duke di Gravina on mules, accompanied by a\
few horsemen, went towards the duke; Vitellozo, unarmed and wearing a\
cape lined with green, appeared very dejected, as if conscious of his\
approaching death--a circumstance which, in view of the ability of the\
man and his former fortune, caused some amazement. And it is said that\
when he parted from his men before setting out for Sinigalia to meet the\
duke he acted as if it were his last parting from them. He recommended\
his house and its fortunes to his captains, and advised his nephews that\
it was not the fortune of their house, but the virtues of their fathers\
that should be kept in mind. These three, therefore, came before\
the duke and saluted him respectfully, and were received by him with\
goodwill; they were at once placed between those who were commissioned\
to look after them.\
\
But the duke noticing that Oliverotto, who had remained with his band in\
Sinigalia, was missing--for Oliverotto was waiting in the square before\
his quarters near the river, keeping his men in order and drilling\
them--signalled with his eye to Don Michelle, to whom the care of\
Oliverotto had been committed, that he should take measures that\
Oliverotto should not escape. Therefore Don Michele rode off and joined\
Oliverotto, telling him that it was not right to keep his men out of\
their quarters, because these might be taken up by the men of the duke;\
and he advised him to send them at once to their quarters and to come\
himself to meet the duke. And Oliverotto, having taken this advice, came\
before the duke, who, when he saw him, called to him; and Oliverotto,\
having made his obeisance, joined the others.\
\
So the whole party entered Sinigalia, dismounted at the duke's quarters,\
and went with him into a secret chamber, where the duke made them\
prisoners; he then mounted on horseback, and issued orders that the men\
of Oliverotto and the Orsini should be stripped of their arms. Those of\
Oliverotto, being at hand, were quickly settled, but those of the Orsini\
and Vitelli, being at a distance, and having a presentiment of the\
destruction of their masters, had time to prepare themselves, and\
bearing in mind the valour and discipline of the Orsinian and Vitellian\
houses, they stood together against the hostile forces of the country\
and saved themselves.\
\
But the duke's soldiers, not being content with having pillaged the\
men of Oliverotto, began to sack Sinigalia, and if the duke had\
not repressed this outrage by killing some of them they would have\
completely sacked it. Night having come and the tumult being silenced,\
the duke prepared to kill Vitellozzo and Oliverotto; he led them into\
a room and caused them to be strangled. Neither of them used words in\
keeping with their past lives: Vitellozzo prayed that he might ask of\
the pope full pardon for his sins; Oliverotto cringed and laid the blame\
for all injuries against the duke on Vitellozzo. Pagolo and the Duke di\
Gravina Orsini were kept alive until the duke heard from Rome that the\
pope had taken the Cardinal Orsino, the Archbishop of Florence, and\
Messer Jacopo da Santa Croce. After which news, on 18th January 1502, in\
the castle of Pieve, they also were strangled in the same way.\

THE LIFE OF CASTRUCCIO CASTRACANI OF LUCCA\

\
\
CASTRUCCIO CASTRACANI 1284-1328\
\
It appears, dearest Zanobi and Luigi, a wonderful thing to those who\
have considered the matter, that all men, or the larger number of them,\
who have performed great deeds in the world, and excelled all others in\
their day, have had their birth and beginning in baseness and obscurity;\
or have been aggrieved by Fortune in some outrageous way. They have\
either been exposed to the mercy of wild beasts, or they have had so\
mean a parentage that in shame they have given themselves out to be\
sons of Jove or of some other deity. It would be wearisome to relate who\
these persons may have been because they are well known to everybody,\
and, as such tales would not be particularly edifying to those who read\
them, they are omitted. I believe that these lowly beginnings of great\
men occur because Fortune is desirous of showing to the world that such\
men owe much to her and little to wisdom, because she begins to show\
her hand when wisdom can really take no part in their career: thus all\
success must be attributed to her. Castruccio Castracani of Lucca was\
one of those men who did great deeds, if he is measured by the times in\
which he lived and the city in which he was born; but, like many others,\
he was neither fortunate nor distinguished in his birth, as the course\
of this history will show. It appeared to be desirable to recall his\
memory, because I have discerned in him such indications of valour and\
fortune as should make him a great exemplar to men. I think also that\
I ought to call your attention to his actions, because you of all men I\
know delight most in noble deeds.\
\
The family of Castracani was formerly numbered among the noble families\
of Lucca, but in the days of which I speak it had somewhat fallen in\
estate, as so often happens in this world. To this family was born a son\
Antonio, who became a priest of the order of San Michele of Lucca, and\
for this reason was honoured with the title of Messer Antonio. He had an\
only sister, who had been married to Buonaccorso Cenami, but Buonaccorso\
dying she became a widow, and not wishing to marry again went to live\
with her brother. Messer Antonio had a vineyard behind the house where\
he resided, and as it was bounded on all sides by gardens, any person\
could have access to it without difficulty. One morning, shortly after\
sunrise, Madonna Dianora, as the sister of Messer Antonio was called,\
had occasion to go into the vineyard as usual to gather herbs for\
seasoning the dinner, and hearing a slight rustling among the leaves\
of a vine she turned her eyes in that direction, and heard something\
resembling the cry of an infant. Whereupon she went towards it, and saw\
the hands and face of a baby who was lying enveloped in the leaves and\
who seemed to be crying for its mother. Partly wondering and partly\
fearing, yet full of compassion, she lifted it up and carried it to\
the house, where she washed it and clothed it with clean linen as is\
customary, and showed it to Messer Antonio when he returned home. When\
he heard what had happened and saw the child he was not less surprised\
or compassionate than his sister. They discussed between themselves\
what should be done, and seeing that he was priest and that she had no\
children, they finally determined to bring it up. They had a nurse for\
it, and it was reared and loved as if it were their own child. They\
baptized it, and gave it the name of Castruccio after their father. As\
the years passed Castruccio grew very handsome, and gave evidence of\
wit and discretion, and learnt with a quickness beyond his years those\
lessons which Messer Antonio imparted to him. Messer Antonio intended\
to make a priest of him, and in time would have inducted him into his\
canonry and other benefices, and all his instruction was given with\
this object; but Antonio discovered that the character of Castruccio was\
quite unfitted for the priesthood. As soon as Castruccio reached the\
age of fourteen he began to take less notice of the chiding of Messer\
Antonio and Madonna Dianora and no longer to fear them; he left\
off reading ecclesiastical books, and turned to playing with arms,\
delighting in nothing so much as in learning their uses, and in running,\
leaping, and wrestling with other boys. In all exercises he far excelled\
his companions in courage and bodily strength, and if at any time he did\
turn to books, only those pleased him which told of wars and the mighty\
deeds of men. Messer Antonio beheld all this with vexation and sorrow.\
\
There lived in the city of Lucca a gentleman of the Guinigi family,\
named Messer Francesco, whose profession was arms and who in riches,\
bodily strength, and valour excelled all other men in Lucca. He had\
often fought under the command of the Visconti of Milan, and as a\
Ghibelline was the valued leader of that party in Lucca. This gentleman\
resided in Lucca and was accustomed to assemble with others most\
mornings and evenings under the balcony of the Podesta, which is at the\
top of the square of San Michele, the finest square in Lucca, and he had\
often seen Castruccio taking part with other children of the street\
in those games of which I have spoken. Noticing that Castruccio far\
excelled the other boys, and that he appeared to exercise a royal\
authority over them, and that they loved and obeyed him, Messer\
Francesco became greatly desirous of learning who he was. Being informed\
of the circumstances of the bringing up of Castruccio he felt a greater\
desire to have him near to him. Therefore he called him one day and\
asked him whether he would more willingly live in the house of a\
gentleman, where he would learn to ride horses and use arms, or in\
the house of a priest, where he would learn nothing but masses and\
the services of the Church. Messer Francesco could see that it pleased\
Castruccio greatly to hear horses and arms spoken of, even though\
he stood silent, blushing modestly; but being encouraged by Messer\
Francesco to speak, he answered that, if his master were agreeable,\
nothing would please him more than to give up his priestly studies and\
take up those of a soldier. This reply delighted Messer Francesco, and\
in a very short time he obtained the consent of Messer Antonio, who was\
driven to yield by his knowledge of the nature of the lad, and the fear\
that he would not be able to hold him much longer.\
\
Thus Castruccio passed from the house of Messer Antonio the priest\
to the house of Messer Francesco Guinigi the soldier, and it was\
astonishing to find that in a very short time he manifested all that\
virtue and bearing which we are accustomed to associate with a true\
gentleman. In the first place he became an accomplished horseman, and\
could manage with ease the most fiery charger, and in all jousts and\
tournaments, although still a youth, he was observed beyond all others,\
and he excelled in all exercises of strength and dexterity. But what\
enhanced so much the charm of these accomplishments, was the delightful\
modesty which enabled him to avoid offence in either act or word to\
others, for he was deferential to the great men, modest with his equals,\
and courteous to his inferiors. These gifts made him beloved, not only\
by all the Guinigi family, but by all Lucca. When Castruccio had reached\
his eighteenth year, the Ghibellines were driven from Pavia by the\
Guelphs, and Messer Francesco was sent by the Visconti to assist the\
Ghibellines, and with him went Castruccio, in charge of his forces.\
Castruccio gave ample proof of his prudence and courage in this\
expedition, acquiring greater reputation than any other captain, and\
his name and fame were known, not only in Pavia, but throughout all\
Lombardy.\
\
Castruccio, having returned to Lucca in far higher estimation that he\
left it, did not omit to use all the means in his power to gain as many\
friends as he could, neglecting none of those arts which are necessary\
for that purpose. About this time Messer Francesco died, leaving a son\
thirteen years of age named Pagolo, and having appointed Castruccio\
to be his son's tutor and administrator of his estate. Before he died\
Francesco called Castruccio to him, and prayed him to show Pagolo that\
goodwill which he (Francesco) had always shown to HIM, and to render to\
the son the gratitude which he had not been able to repay to the father.\
Upon the death of Francesco, Castruccio became the governor and tutor of\
Pagolo, which increased enormously his power and position, and created\
a certain amount of envy against him in Lucca in place of the former\
universal goodwill, for many men suspected him of harbouring tyrannical\
intentions. Among these the leading man was Giorgio degli Opizi, the\
head of the Guelph party. This man hoped after the death of Messer\
Francesco to become the chief man in Lucca, but it seemed to him that\
Castruccio, with the great abilities which he already showed, and\
holding the position of governor, deprived him of his opportunity;\
therefore he began to sow those seeds which should rob Castruccio of his\
eminence. Castruccio at first treated this with scorn, but afterwards\
he grew alarmed, thinking that Messer Giorgio might be able to bring\
him into disgrace with the deputy of King Ruberto of Naples and have him\
driven out of Lucca.\
\
The Lord of Pisa at that time was Uguccione of the Faggiuola of Arezzo,\
who being in the first place elected their captain afterwards became\
their lord. There resided in Paris some exiled Ghibellines from Lucca,\
with whom Castruccio held communications with the object of effecting\
their restoration by the help of Uguccione. Castruccio also brought into\
his plans friends from Lucca who would not endure the authority of the\
Opizi. Having fixed upon a plan to be followed, Castruccio cautiously\
fortified the tower of the Onesti, filling it with supplies and\
munitions of war, in order that it might stand a siege for a few days\
in case of need. When the night came which had been agreed upon with\
Uguccione, who had occupied the plain between the mountains and\
Pisa with many men, the signal was given, and without being observed\
Uguccione approached the gate of San Piero and set fire to the\
portcullis. Castruccio raised a great uproar within the city, calling\
the people to arms and forcing open the gate from his side. Uguccione\
entered with his men, poured through the town, and killed Messer Giorgio\
with all his family and many of his friends and supporters. The governor\
was driven out, and the government reformed according to the wishes of\
Uguccione, to the detriment of the city, because it was found that more\
than one hundred families were exiled at that time. Of those who\
fled, part went to Florence and part to Pistoia, which city was the\
headquarters of the Guelph party, and for this reason it became most\
hostile to Uguccione and the Lucchese.\
\
As it now appeared to the Florentines and others of the Guelph party\
that the Ghibellines absorbed too much power in Tuscany, they determined\
to restore the exiled Guelphs to Lucca. They assembled a large army in\
the Val di Nievole, and seized Montecatini; from thence they marched to\
Montecarlo, in order to secure the free passage into Lucca. Upon this\
Uguccione assembled his Pisan and Lucchese forces, and with a number\
of German cavalry which he drew out of Lombardy, he moved against\
the quarters of the Florentines, who upon the appearance of the enemy\
withdrew from Montecarlo, and posted themselves between Montecatini and\
Pescia. Uguccione now took up a position near to Montecarlo, and within\
about two miles of the enemy, and slight skirmishes between the horse\
of both parties were of daily occurrence. Owing to the illness of\
Uguccione, the Pisans and Lucchese delayed coming to battle with the\
enemy. Uguccione, finding himself growing worse, went to Montecarlo to\
be cured, and left the command of the army in the hands of Castruccio.\
This change brought about the ruin of the Guelphs, who, thinking\
that the hostile army having lost its captain had lost its head, grew\
over-confident. Castruccio observed this, and allowed some days to pass\
in order to encourage this belief; he also showed signs of fear, and\
did not allow any of the munitions of the camp to be used. On the other\
side, the Guelphs grew more insolent the more they saw these evidences\
of fear, and every day they drew out in the order of battle in front\
of the army of Castruccio. Presently, deeming that the enemy was\
sufficiently emboldened, and having mastered their tactics, he decided\
to join battle with them. First he spoke a few words of encouragement to\
his soldiers, and pointed out to them the certainty of victory if they\
would but obey his commands. Castruccio had noticed how the enemy had\
placed all his best troops in the centre of the line of battle, and his\
less reliable men on the wings of the army; whereupon he did exactly\
the opposite, putting his most valiant men on the flanks, while those\
on whom he could not so strongly rely he moved to the centre. Observing\
this order of battle, he drew out of his lines and quickly came in sight\
of the hostile army, who, as usual, had come in their insolence to defy\
him. He then commanded his centre squadrons to march slowly, whilst\
he moved rapidly forward those on the wings. Thus, when they came into\
contact with the enemy, only the wings of the two armies became engaged,\
whilst the center battalions remained out of action, for these two\
portions of the line of battle were separated from each other by a long\
interval and thus unable to reach each other. By this expedient the more\
valiant part of Castruccio's men were opposed to the weaker part of the\
enemy's troops, and the most efficient men of the enemy were disengaged;\
and thus the Florentines were unable to fight with those who were\
arrayed opposite to them, or to give any assistance to their own flanks.\
So, without much difficulty, Castruccio put the enemy to flight on\
both flanks, and the centre battalions took to flight when they found\
themselves exposed to attack, without having a chance of displaying\
their valour. The defeat was complete, and the loss in men very heavy,\
there being more than ten thousand men killed with many officers and\
knights of the Guelph party in Tuscany, and also many princes who had\
come to help them, among whom were Piero, the brother of King Ruberto,\
and Carlo, his nephew, and Filippo, the lord of Taranto. On the part of\
Castruccio the loss did not amount to more than three hundred men, among\
whom was Francesco, the son of Uguccione, who, being young and rash, was\
killed in the first onset.\
\
This victory so greatly increased the reputation of Castruccio that\
Uguccione conceived some jealousy and suspicion of him, because it\
appeared to Uguccione that this victory had given him no increase of\
power, but rather than diminished it. Being of this mind, he only waited\
for an opportunity to give effect to it. This occurred on the death of\
Pier Agnolo Micheli, a man of great repute and abilities in Lucca, the\
murderer of whom fled to the house of Castruccio for refuge. On the\
sergeants of the captain going to arrest the murderer, they were driven\
off by Castruccio, and the murderer escaped. This affair coming to\
the knowledge of Uguccione, who was than at Pisa, it appeared to him a\
proper opportunity to punish Castruccio. He therefore sent for his\
son Neri, who was the governor of Lucca, and commissioned him to take\
Castruccio prisoner at a banquet and put him to death. Castruccio,\
fearing no evil, went to the governor in a friendly way, was entertained\
at supper, and then thrown into prison. But Neri, fearing to put him to\
death lest the people should be incensed, kept him alive, in order to\
hear further from his father concerning his intentions. Ugucionne cursed\
the hesitation and cowardice of his son, and at once set out from Pisa\
to Lucca with four hundred horsemen to finish the business in his own\
way; but he had not yet reached the baths when the Pisans rebelled and\
put his deputy to death and created Count Gaddo della Gherardesca their\
lord. Before Uguccione reached Lucca he heard of the occurrences at\
Pisa, but it did not appear wise to him to turn back, lest the Lucchese\
with the example of Pisa before them should close their gates against\
him. But the Lucchese, having heard of what had happened at Pisa,\
availed themselves of this opportunity to demand the liberation of\
Castruccio, notwithstanding that Uguccione had arrived in their city.\
They first began to speak of it in private circles, afterwards openly\
in the squares and streets; then they raised a tumult, and with arms in\
their hands went to Uguccione and demanded that Castruccio should be\
set at liberty. Uguccione, fearing that worse might happen, released him\
from prison. Whereupon Castruccio gathered his friends around him, and\
with the help of the people attacked Uguccione; who, finding he had no\
resource but in flight, rode away with his friends to Lombardy, to the\
lords of Scale, where he died in poverty.\
\
But Castruccio from being a prisoner became almost a prince in Lucca,\
and he carried himself so discreetly with his friends and the people\
that they appointed him captain of their army for one year. Having\
obtained this, and wishing to gain renown in war, he planned the\
recovery of the many towns which had rebelled after the departure of\
Uguccione, and with the help of the Pisans, with whom he had concluded a\
treaty, he marched to Serezzana. To capture this place he constructed a\
fort against it, which is called to-day Zerezzanello; in the course of\
two months Castruccio captured the town. With the reputation gained\
at that siege, he rapidly seized Massa, Carrara, and Lavenza, and in\
a short time had overrun the whole of Lunigiana. In order to close the\
pass which leads from Lombardy to Lunigiana, he besieged Pontremoli and\
wrested it from the hands of Messer Anastagio Palavicini, who was the\
lord of it. After this victory he returned to Lucca, and was welcomed by\
the whole people. And now Castruccio, deeming it imprudent any longer to\
defer making himself a prince, got himself created the lord of Lucca\
by the help of Pazzino del Poggio, Puccinello dal Portico, Francesco\
Boccansacchi, and Cecco Guinigi, all of whom he had corrupted; and he\
was afterwards solemnly and deliberately elected prince by the people.\
At this time Frederick of Bavaria, the King of the Romans, came into\
Italy to assume the Imperial crown, and Castruccio, in order that\
he might make friends with him, met him at the head of five hundred\
horsemen. Castruccio had left as his deputy in Lucca, Pagolo Guinigi,\
who was held in high estimation, because of the people's love for\
the memory of his father. Castruccio was received in great honour by\
Frederick, and many privileges were conferred upon him, and he was\
appointed the emperor's lieutenant in Tuscany. At this time the Pisans\
were in great fear of Gaddo della Gherardesca, whom they had driven out\
of Pisa, and they had recourse for assistance to Frederick. Frederick\
created Castruccio the lord of Pisa, and the Pisans, in dread of the\
Guelph party, and particularly of the Florentines, were constrained to\
accept him as their lord.\
\
Frederick, having appointed a governor in Rome to watch his Italian\
affairs, returned to Germany. All the Tuscan and Lombardian Ghibellines,\
who followed the imperial lead, had recourse to Castruccio for help\
and counsel, and all promised him the governorship of his country,\
if enabled to recover it with his assistance. Among these exiles were\
Matteo Guidi, Nardo Scolari, Lapo Uberti, Gerozzo Nardi, and Piero\
Buonaccorsi, all exiled Florentines and Ghibellines. Castruccio had the\
secret intention of becoming the master of all Tuscany by the aid of\
these men and of his own forces; and in order to gain greater weight\
in affairs, he entered into a league with Messer Matteo Visconti, the\
Prince of Milan, and organized for him the forces of his city and the\
country districts. As Lucca had five gates, he divided his own country\
districts into five parts, which he supplied with arms, and enrolled the\
men under captains and ensigns, so that he could quickly bring into the\
field twenty thousand soldiers, without those whom he could summon to\
his assistance from Pisa. While he surrounded himself with these forces\
and allies, it happened at Messer Matteo Visconti was attacked by\
the Guelphs of Piacenza, who had driven out the Ghibellines with the\
assistance of a Florentine army and the King Ruberto. Messer Matteo\
called upon Castruccio to invade the Florentines in their own\
territories, so that, being attacked at home, they should be compelled\
to draw their army out of Lombardy in order to defend themselves.\
Castruccio invaded the Valdarno, and seized Fucecchio and San Miniato,\
inflicting immense damage upon the country. Whereupon the Florentines\
recalled their army, which had scarcely reached Tuscany, when Castruccio\
was forced by other necessities to return to Lucca.\
\
There resided in the city of Lucca the Poggio family, who were so\
powerful that they could not only elevate Castruccio, but even advance\
him to the dignity of prince; and it appearing to them they had not\
received such rewards for their services as they deserved, they incited\
other families to rebel and to drive Castruccio out of Lucca. They found\
their opportunity one morning, and arming themselves, they set upon the\
lieutenant whom Castruccio had left to maintain order and killed him.\
They endeavoured to raise the people in revolt, but Stefano di Poggio, a\
peaceable old man who had taken no hand in the rebellion, intervened and\
compelled them by his authority to lay down their arms; and he offered\
to be their mediator with Castruccio to obtain from him what\
they desired. Therefore they laid down their arms with no greater\
intelligence than they had taken them up. Castruccio, having heard\
the news of what had happened at Lucca, at once put Pagolo Guinigi\
in command of the army, and with a troop of cavalry set out for home.\
Contrary to his expectations, he found the rebellion at an end, yet he\
posted his men in the most advantageous places throughout the city. As\
it appeared to Stefano that Castruccio ought to be very much obliged to\
him, he sought him out, and without saying anything on his own behalf,\
for he did not recognize any need for doing so, he begged Castruccio to\
pardon the other members of his family by reason of their youth, their\
former friendships, and the obligations which Castruccio was under to\
their house. To this Castruccio graciously responded, and begged Stefano\
to reassure himself, declaring that it gave him more pleasure to find\
the tumult at an end than it had ever caused him anxiety to hear of its\
inception. He encouraged Stefano to bring his family to him, saying\
that he thanked God for having given him the opportunity of showing his\
clemency and liberality. Upon the word of Stefano and Castruccio they\
surrendered, and with Stefano were immediately thrown into prison and\
put to death. Meanwhile the Florentines had recovered San Miniato,\
whereupon it seemed advisable to Castruccio to make peace, as it did not\
appear to him that he was sufficiently secure at Lucca to leave him.\
He approached the Florentines with the proposal of a truce, which they\
readily entertained, for they were weary of the war, and desirous of\
getting rid of the expenses of it. A treaty was concluded with them for\
two years, by which both parties agreed to keep the conquests they had\
made. Castruccio thus released from this trouble, turned his attention\
to affairs in Lucca, and in order that he should not again be subject to\
the perils from which he had just escaped, he, under various pretences\
and reasons, first wiped out all those who by their ambition might\
aspire to the principality; not sparing one of them, but depriving them\
of country and property, and those whom he had in his hands of life\
also, stating that he had found by experience that none of them were to\
be trusted. Then for his further security he raised a fortress in Lucca\
with the stones of the towers of those whom he had killed or hunted out\
of the state.\
\
Whilst Castruccio made peace with the Florentines, and strengthened his\
position in Lucca, he neglected no opportunity, short of open war, of\
increasing his importance elsewhere. It appeared to him that if he could\
get possession of Pistoia, he would have one foot in Florence, which was\
his great desire. He, therefore, in various ways made friends with\
the mountaineers, and worked matters so in Pistoia that both parties\
confided their secrets to him. Pistoia was divided, as it always had\
been, into the Bianchi and Neri parties; the head of the Bianchi was\
Bastiano di Possente, and of the Neri, Jacopo da Gia. Each of these men\
held secret communications with Castruccio, and each desired to drive\
the other out of the city; and, after many threatenings, they came to\
blows. Jacopo fortified himself at the Florentine gate, Bastiano at that\
of the Lucchese side of the city; both trusted more in Castruccio than\
in the Florentines, because they believed that Castruccio was far more\
ready and willing to fight than the Florentines, and they both sent to\
him for assistance. He gave promises to both, saying to Bastiano that he\
would come in person, and to Jacopo that he would send his pupil, Pagolo\
Guinigi. At the appointed time he sent forward Pagolo by way of Pisa,\
and went himself direct to Pistoia; at midnight both of them met outside\
the city, and both were admitted as friends. Thus the two leaders\
entered, and at a signal given by Castruccio, one killed Jacopo da Gia,\
and the other Bastiano di Possente, and both took prisoners or killed\
the partisans of either faction. Without further opposition Pistoia\
passed into the hands of Castruccio, who, having forced the Signoria to\
leave the palace, compelled the people to yield obedience to him,\
making them many promises and remitting their old debts. The countryside\
flocked to the city to see the new prince, and all were filled with hope\
and quickly settled down, influenced in a great measure by his great\
valour.\
\
About this time great disturbances arose in Rome, owing to the dearness\
of living which was caused by the absence of the pontiff at Avignon. The\
German governor, Enrico, was much blamed for what happened--murders and\
tumults following each other daily, without his being able to put an end\
to them. This caused Enrico much anxiety lest the Romans should call\
in Ruberto, the King of Naples, who would drive the Germans out of the\
city, and bring back the Pope. Having no nearer friend to whom he could\
apply for help than Castruccio, he sent to him, begging him not only\
to give him assistance, but also to come in person to Rome. Castruccio\
considered that he ought not to hesitate to render the emperor this\
service, because he believed that he himself would not be safe if at any\
time the emperor ceased to hold Rome. Leaving Pagolo Guinigi in command\
at Lucca, Castruccio set out for Rome with six hundred horsemen, where\
he was received by Enrico with the greatest distinction. In a short time\
the presence of Castruccio obtained such respect for the emperor that,\
without bloodshed or violence, good order was restored, chiefly by\
reason of Castruccio having sent by sea from the country round Pisa\
large quantities of corn, and thus removed the source of the trouble.\
When he had chastised some of the Roman leaders, and admonished others,\
voluntary obedience was rendered to Enrico. Castruccio received many\
honours, and was made a Roman senator. This dignity was assumed with the\
greatest pomp, Castruccio being clothed in a brocaded toga, which had\
the following words embroidered on its front: "I am what God wills."\
Whilst on the back was: "What God desires shall be."\
\
During this time the Florentines, who were much enraged that Castruccio\
should have seized Pistoia during the truce, considered how they could\
tempt the city to rebel, to do which they thought would not be difficult\
in his absence. Among the exiled Pistoians in Florence were Baldo Cecchi\
and Jacopo Baldini, both men of leading and ready to face danger. These\
men kept up communications with their friends in Pistoia, and with the\
aid of the Florentines entered the city by night, and after driving out\
some of Castruccio's officials and partisans, and killing others, they\
restored the city to its freedom. The news of this greatly angered\
Castruccio, and taking leave of Enrico, he pressed on in great haste to\
Pistoia. When the Florentines heard of his return, knowing that he would\
lose no time, they decided to intercept him with their forces in the\
Val di Nievole, under the belief that by doing so they would cut off his\
road to Pistoia. Assembling a great army of the supporters of the Guelph\
cause, the Florentines entered the Pistoian territories. On the other\
hand, Castruccio reached Montecarlo with his army; and having heard\
where the Florentines' lay, he decided not to encounter it in the plains\
of Pistoia, nor to await it in the plains of Pescia, but, as far as\
he possibly could, to attack it boldly in the Pass of Serravalle. He\
believed that if he succeeded in this design, victory was assured,\
although he was informed that the Florentines had thirty thousand men,\
whilst he had only twelve thousand. Although he had every confidence\
in his own abilities and the valour of his troops, yet he hesitated to\
attack his enemy in the open lest he should be overwhelmed by numbers.\
Serravalle is a castle between Pescia and Pistoia, situated on a hill\
which blocks the Val di Nievole, not in the exact pass, but about a\
bowshot beyond; the pass itself is in places narrow and steep, whilst in\
general it ascends gently, but is still narrow, especially at the summit\
where the waters divide, so that twenty men side by side could hold it.\
The lord of Serravalle was Manfred, a German, who, before Castruccio\
became lord of Pistoia, had been allowed to remain in possession of the\
castle, it being common to the Lucchese and the Pistoians, and unclaimed\
by either--neither of them wishing to displace Manfred as long as he\
kept his promise of neutrality, and came under obligations to no one.\
For these reasons, and also because the castle was well fortified,\
he had always been able to maintain his position. It was here that\
Castruccio had determined to fall upon his enemy, for here his few men\
would have the advantage, and there was no fear lest, seeing the large\
masses of the hostile force before they became engaged, they should not\
stand. As soon as this trouble with Florence arose, Castruccio saw the\
immense advantage which possession of this castle would give him, and\
having an intimate friendship with a resident in the castle, he managed\
matters so with him that four hundred of his men were to be admitted\
into the castle the night before the attack on the Florentines, and the\
castellan put to death.\
\
Castruccio, having prepared everything, had now to encourage the\
Florentines to persist in their desire to carry the seat of war away\
from Pistoia into the Val di Nievole, therefore he did not move his\
army from Montecarlo. Thus the Florentines hurried on until they reached\
their encampment under Serravalle, intending to cross the hill on the\
following morning. In the meantime, Castruccio had seized the castle at\
night, had also moved his army from Montecarlo, and marching from thence\
at midnight in dead silence, had reached the foot of Serravalle: thus he\
and the Florentines commenced the ascent of the hill at the same time in\
the morning. Castruccio sent forward his infantry by the main road,\
and a troop of four hundred horsemen by a path on the left towards the\
castle. The Florentines sent forward four hundred cavalry ahead of\
their army which was following, never expecting to find Castruccio in\
possession of the hill, nor were they aware of his having seized the\
castle. Thus it happened that the Florentine horsemen mounting the hill\
were completely taken by surprise when they discovered the infantry of\
Castruccio, and so close were they upon it they had scarcely time to\
pull down their visors. It was a case of unready soldiers being attacked\
by ready, and they were assailed with such vigour that with difficulty\
they could hold their own, although some few of them got through. When\
the noise of the fighting reached the Florentine camp below, it was\
filled with confusion. The cavalry and infantry became inextricably\
mixed: the captains were unable to get their men either backward or\
forward, owing to the narrowness of the pass, and amid all this tumult\
no one knew what ought to be done or what could be done. In a short time\
the cavalry who were engaged with the enemy's infantry were scattered\
or killed without having made any effective defence because of their\
unfortunate position, although in sheer desperation they had offered\
a stout resistance. Retreat had been impossible, with the mountains on\
both flanks, whilst in front were their enemies, and in the rear their\
friends. When Castruccio saw that his men were unable to strike a\
decisive blow at the enemy and put them to flight, he sent one thousand\
infantrymen round by the castle, with orders to join the four hundred\
horsemen he had previously dispatched there, and commanded the whole\
force to fall upon the flank of the enemy. These orders they carried out\
with such fury that the Florentines could not sustain the attack,\
but gave way, and were soon in full retreat--conquered more by their\
unfortunate position than by the valour of their enemy. Those in the\
rear turned towards Pistoia, and spread through the plains, each\
man seeking only his own safety. The defeat was complete and very\
sanguinary. Many captains were taken prisoners, among whom were\
Bandini dei Rossi, Francesco Brunelleschi, and Giovanni della Tosa, all\
Florentine noblemen, with many Tuscans and Neapolitans who fought on the\
Florentine side, having been sent by King Ruberto to assist the Guelphs.\
Immediately the Pistoians heard of this defeat they drove out the\
friends of the Guelphs, and surrendered to Castruccio. He was not\
content with occupying Prato and all the castles on the plains on both\
sides of the Arno, but marched his army into the plain of Peretola,\
about two miles from Florence. Here he remained many days, dividing the\
spoils, and celebrating his victory with feasts and games, holding\
horse races, and foot races for men and women. He also struck medals\
in commemoration of the defeat of the Florentines. He endeavoured to\
corrupt some of the citizens of Florence, who were to open the city\
gates at night; but the conspiracy was discovered, and the participators\
in it taken and beheaded, among whom were Tommaso Lupacci and\
Lambertuccio Frescobaldi. This defeat caused the Florentines great\
anxiety, and despairing of preserving their liberty, they sent envoys to\
King Ruberto of Naples, offering him the dominion of their city; and he,\
knowing of what immense importance the maintenance of the Guelph cause\
was to him, accepted it. He agreed with the Florentines to receive from\
them a yearly tribute of two hundred thousand florins, and he send his\
son Carlo to Florence with four thousand horsemen.\
\
Shortly after this the Florentines were relieved in some degree of the\
pressure of Castruccio's army, owing to his being compelled to leave\
his positions before Florence and march on Pisa, in order to suppress a\
conspiracy that had been raised against him by Benedetto Lanfranchi,\
one of the first men in Pisa, who could not endure that his fatherland\
should be under the dominion of the Lucchese. He had formed this\
conspiracy, intending to seize the citadel, kill the partisans of\
Castruccio, and drive out the garrison. As, however, in a conspiracy\
paucity of numbers is essential to secrecy, so for its execution a few\
are not sufficient, and in seeking more adherents to his conspiracy\
Lanfranchi encountered a person who revealed the design to Castruccio.\
This betrayal cannot be passed by without severe reproach to Bonifacio\
Cerchi and Giovanni Guidi, two Florentine exiles who were suffering\
their banishment in Pisa. Thereupon Castruccio seized Benedetto and put\
him to death, and beheaded many other noble citizens, and drove their\
families into exile. It now appeared to Castruccio that both Pisa and\
Pistoia were thoroughly disaffected; he employed much thought and energy\
upon securing his position there, and this gave the Florentines their\
opportunity to reorganize their army, and to await the coming of Carlo,\
the son of the King of Naples. When Carlo arrived they decided to lose\
no more time, and assembled a great army of more than thirty thousand\
infantry and ten thousand cavalry--having called to their aid every\
Guelph there was in Italy. They consulted whether they should attack\
Pistoia or Pisa first, and decided that it would be better to march on\
the latter--a course, owing to the recent conspiracy, more likely to\
succeed, and of more advantage to them, because they believed that the\
surrender of Pistoia would follow the acquisition of Pisa.\
\
In the early part of May 1328, the Florentines put in motion this army\
and quickly occupied Lastra, Signa, Montelupo, and Empoli, passing from\
thence on to San Miniato. When Castruccio heard of the enormous army\
which the Florentines were sending against him, he was in no degree\
alarmed, believing that the time had now arrived when Fortune would\
deliver the empire of Tuscany into his hands, for he had no reason to\
think that his enemy would make a better fight, or had better prospects\
of success, than at Pisa or Serravalle. He assembled twenty thousand\
foot soldiers and four thousand horsemen, and with this army went to\
Fucecchio, whilst he sent Pagolo Guinigi to Pisa with five thousand\
infantry. Fucecchio has a stronger position than any other town in\
the Pisan district, owing to its situation between the rivers Arno and\
Gusciana and its slight elevation above the surrounding plain. Moreover,\
the enemy could not hinder its being victualled unless they divided\
their forces, nor could they approach it either from the direction\
of Lucca or Pisa, nor could they get through to Pisa, or attack\
Castruccio's forces except at a disadvantage. In one case they would\
find themselves placed between his two armies, the one under his own\
command and the other under Pagolo, and in the other case they would\
have to cross the Arno to get to close quarters with the enemy, an\
undertaking of great hazard. In order to tempt the Florentines to take\
this latter course, Castruccio withdrew his men from the banks of the\
river and placed them under the walls of Fucecchio, leaving a wide\
expanse of land between them and the river.\
\
The Florentines, having occupied San Miniato, held a council of war to\
decide whether they should attack Pisa or the army of Castruccio, and,\
having weighed the difficulties of both courses, they decided upon the\
latter. The river Arno was at that time low enough to be fordable, yet\
the water reached to the shoulders of the infantrymen and to the\
saddles of the horsemen. On the morning of 10 June 1328, the Florentines\
commenced the battle by ordering forward a number of cavalry and ten\
thousand infantry. Castruccio, whose plan of action was fixed, and\
who well knew what to do, at once attacked the Florentines with five\
thousand infantry and three thousand horsemen, not allowing them to\
issue from the river before he charged them; he also sent one thousand\
light infantry up the river bank, and the same number down the Arno. The\
infantry of the Florentines were so much impeded by their arms and the\
water that they were not able to mount the banks of the river, whilst\
the cavalry had made the passage of the river more difficult for the\
others, by reason of the few who had crossed having broken up the bed of\
the river, and this being deep with mud, many of the horses rolled over\
with their riders and many of them had stuck so fast that they could not\
move. When the Florentine captains saw the difficulties their men were\
meeting, they withdrew them and moved higher up the river, hoping to\
find the river bed less treacherous and the banks more adapted for\
landing. These men were met at the bank by the forces which Castruccio\
had already sent forward, who, being light armed with bucklers and\
javelins in their hands, let fly with tremendous shouts into the faces\
and bodies of the cavalry. The horses, alarmed by the noise and the\
wounds, would not move forward, and trampled each other in great\
confusion. The fight between the men of Castruccio and those of the\
enemy who succeeded in crossing was sharp and terrible; both sides\
fought with the utmost desperation and neither would yield. The soldiers\
of Castruccio fought to drive the others back into the river, whilst the\
Florentines strove to get a footing on land in order to make room for\
the others pressing forward, who if they could but get out of the water\
would be able to fight, and in this obstinate conflict they were urged\
on by their captains. Castruccio shouted to his men that these were the\
same enemies whom they had before conquered at Serravalle, whilst the\
Florentines reproached each other that the many should be overcome by\
the few. At length Castruccio, seeing how long the battle had lasted,\
and that both his men and the enemy were utterly exhausted, and that\
both sides had many killed and wounded, pushed forward another body of\
infantry to take up a position at the rear of those who were fighting;\
he then commanded these latter to open their ranks as if they intended\
to retreat, and one part of them to turn to the right and another to\
the left. This cleared a space of which the Florentines at once took\
advantage, and thus gained possession of a portion of the battlefield.\
But when these tired soldiers found themselves at close quarters with\
Castruccio's reserves they could not stand against them and at once fell\
back into the river. The cavalry of either side had not as yet gained\
any decisive advantage over the other, because Castruccio, knowing his\
inferiority in this arm, had commanded his leaders only to stand on the\
defensive against the attacks of their adversaries, as he hoped that\
when he had overcome the infantry he would be able to make short work\
of the cavalry. This fell out as he had hoped, for when he saw the\
Florentine army driven back across the river he ordered the remainder\
of his infantry to attack the cavalry of the enemy. This they did with\
lance and javelin, and, joined by their own cavalry, fell upon the\
enemy with the greatest fury and soon put him to flight. The Florentine\
captains, having seen the difficulty their cavalry had met with in\
crossing the river, had attempted to make their infantry cross lower\
down the river, in order to attack the flanks of Castruccio's army.\
But here, also, the banks were steep and already lined by the men of\
Castruccio, and this movement was quite useless. Thus the Florentines\
were so completely defeated at all points that scarcely a third of them\
escaped, and Castruccio was again covered with glory. Many captains were\
taken prisoners, and Carlo, the son of King Ruberto, with Michelagnolo\
Falconi and Taddeo degli Albizzi, the Florentine commissioners, fled to\
Empoli. If the spoils were great, the slaughter was infinitely greater,\
as might be expected in such a battle. Of the Florentines there fell\
twenty thousand two hundred and thirty-one men, whilst Castruccio lost\
one thousand five hundred and seventy men.\
\
But Fortune growing envious of the glory of Castruccio took away his\
life just at the time when she should have preserved it, and thus ruined\
all those plans which for so long a time he had worked to carry into\
effect, and in the successful prosecution of which nothing but death\
could have stopped him. Castruccio was in the thick of the battle the\
whole of the day; and when the end of it came, although fatigued and\
overheated, he stood at the gate of Fucecchio to welcome his men on\
their return from victory and personally thank them. He was also on the\
watch for any attempt of the enemy to retrieve the fortunes of the day;\
he being of the opinion that it was the duty of a good general to be the\
first man in the saddle and the last out of it. Here Castruccio stood\
exposed to a wind which often rises at midday on the banks of the Arno,\
and which is often very unhealthy; from this he took a chill, of which\
he thought nothing, as he was accustomed to such troubles; but it was\
the cause of his death. On the following night he was attacked with high\
fever, which increased so rapidly that the doctors saw it must prove\
fatal. Castruccio, therefore, called Pagolo Guinigi to him, and\
addressed him as follows:\
\
"If I could have believed that Fortune would have cut me off in the\
midst of the career which was leading to that glory which all my\
successes promised, I should have laboured less, and I should have\
left thee, if a smaller state, at least with fewer enemies and perils,\
because I should have been content with the governorships of Lucca and\
Pisa. I should neither have subjugated the Pistoians, nor outraged the\
Florentines with so many injuries. But I would have made both these\
peoples my friends, and I should have lived, if no longer, at least more\
peacefully, and have left you a state without a doubt smaller, but one\
more secure and established on a surer foundation. But Fortune, who\
insists upon having the arbitrament of human affairs, did not endow me\
with sufficient judgment to recognize this from the first, nor the time\
to surmount it. Thou hast heard, for many have told thee, and I have\
never concealed it, how I entered the house of thy father whilst yet a\
boy--a stranger to all those ambitions which every generous soul should\
feel--and how I was brought up by him, and loved as though I had been\
born of his blood; how under his governance I learned to be valiant and\
capable of availing myself of all that fortune, of which thou hast been\
witness. When thy good father came to die, he committed thee and all his\
possessions to my care, and I have brought thee up with that love, and\
increased thy estate with that care, which I was bound to show. And in\
order that thou shouldst not only possess the estate which thy father\
left, but also that which my fortune and abilities have gained, I have\
never married, so that the love of children should never deflect my mind\
from that gratitude which I owed to the children of thy father. Thus I\
leave thee a vast estate, of which I am well content, but I am deeply\
concerned, inasmuch as I leave it thee unsettled and insecure. Thou hast\
the city of Lucca on thy hands, which will never rest contented under\
they government. Thou hast also Pisa, where the men are of nature\
changeable and unreliable, who, although they may be sometimes held\
in subjection, yet they will ever disdain to serve under a Lucchese.\
Pistoia is also disloyal to thee, she being eaten up with factions and\
deeply incensed against thy family by reason of the wrongs recently\
inflicted upon them. Thou hast for neighbours the offended Florentines,\
injured by us in a thousand ways, but not utterly destroyed, who\
will hail the news of my death with more delight than they would the\
acquisition of all Tuscany. In the Emperor and in the princes of Milan\
thou canst place no reliance, for they are far distant, slow, and their\
help is very long in coming. Therefore, thou hast no hope in anything\
but in thine own abilities, and in the memory of my valour, and in the\
prestige which this latest victory has brought thee; which, as thou\
knowest how to use it with prudence, will assist thee to come to terms\
with the Florentines, who, as they are suffering under this great\
defeat, should be inclined to listen to thee. And whereas I have sought\
to make them my enemies, because I believed that war with them would\
conduce to my power and glory, thou hast every inducement to make\
friends of them, because their alliance will bring thee advantages\
and security. It is of the greatest important in this world that a man\
should know himself, and the measure of his own strength and means; and\
he who knows that he has not a genius for fighting must learn how to\
govern by the arts of peace. And it will be well for thee to rule\
they conduct by my counsel, and to learn in this way to enjoy what my\
life-work and dangers have gained; and in this thou wilt easily succeed\
when thou hast learnt to believe that what I have told thee is true. And\
thou wilt be doubly indebted to me, in that I have left thee this realm\
and have taught thee how to keep it."\
\
After this there came to Castruccio those citizens of Pisa, Pistoia, and\
Lucca, who had been fighting at his side, and whilst recommending Pagolo\
to them, and making them swear obedience to him as his successor, he\
died. He left a happy memory to those who had known him, and no\
prince of those times was ever loved with such devotion as he was. His\
obsequies were celebrated with every sign of mourning, and he was buried\
in San Francesco at Lucca. Fortune was not so friendly to Pagolo Guinigi\
as she had been to Castruccio, for he had not the abilities. Not long\
after the death of Castruccio, Pagolo lost Pisa, and then Pistoia, and\
only with difficulty held on to Lucca. This latter city continued in the\
family of Guinigi until the time of the great-grandson of Pagolo.\
\
From what has been related here it will be seen that Castruccio was a\
man of exceptional abilities, not only measured by men of his own\
time, but also by those of an earlier date. In stature he was above\
the ordinary height, and perfectly proportioned. He was of a gracious\
presence, and he welcomed men with such urbanity that those who spoke\
with him rarely left him displeased. His hair was inclined to be red,\
and he wore it cut short above the ears, and, whether it rained or\
snowed, he always went without a hat. He was delightful among friends,\
but terrible to his enemies; just to his subjects; ready to play false\
with the unfaithful, and willing to overcome by fraud those whom he\
desired to subdue, because he was wont to say that it was the victory\
that brought the glory, not the methods of achieving it. No one was\
bolder in facing danger, none more prudent in extricating himself. He\
was accustomed to say that men ought to attempt everything and fear\
nothing; that God is a lover of strong men, because one always sees that\
the weak are chastised by the strong. He was also wonderfully sharp or\
biting though courteous in his answers; and as he did not look for any\
indulgence in this way of speaking from others, so he was not angered\
with others did not show it to him. It has often happened that he has\
listened quietly when others have spoken sharply to him, as on the\
following occasions. He had caused a ducat to be given for a partridge,\
and was taken to task for doing so by a friend, to whom Castruccio had\
said: "You would not have given more than a penny." "That is true,"\
answered the friend. Then said Castruccio to him: "A ducat is much less\
to me." Having about him a flatterer on whom he had spat to show that\
he scorned him, the flatterer said to him: "Fisherman are willing to let\
the waters of the sea saturate them in order that they make take a few\
little fishes, and I allow myself to be wetted by spittle that I may\
catch a whale"; and this was not only heard by Castruccio with patience\
but rewarded. When told by a priest that it was wicked for him to live\
so sumptuously, Castruccio said: "If that be a vice than you should\
not fare so splendidly at the feasts of our saints." Passing through a\
street he saw a young man as he came out of a house of ill fame blush at\
being seen by Castruccio, and said to him: "Thou shouldst not be ashamed\
when thou comest out, but when thou goest into such places." A friend\
gave him a very curiously tied knot to undo and was told: "Fool, do\
you think that I wish to untie a thing which gave so much trouble to\
fasten." Castruccio said to one who professed to be a philosopher: "You\
are like the dogs who always run after those who will give them the best\
to eat," and was answered: "We are rather like the doctors who go to the\
houses of those who have the greatest need of them." Going by water from\
Pisa to Leghorn, Castruccio was much disturbed by a dangerous storm that\
sprang up, and was reproached for cowardice by one of those with him,\
who said that he did not fear anything. Castruccio answered that he\
did not wonder at that, since every man valued his soul for what is was\
worth. Being asked by one what he ought to do to gain estimation, he\
said: "When thou goest to a banquet take care that thou dost not seat\
one piece of wood upon another." To a person who was boasting that he\
had read many things, Castruccio said: "He knows better than to boast\
of remembering many things." Someone bragged that he could drink much\
without becoming intoxicated. Castruccio replied: "An ox does the\
same." Castruccio was acquainted with a girl with whom he had intimate\
relations, and being blamed by a friend who told him that it was\
undignified for him to be taken in by a woman, he said: "She has not\
taken me in, I have taken her." Being also blamed for eating very dainty\
foods, he answered: "Thou dost not spend as much as I do?" and being\
told that it was true, he continued: "Then thou art more avaricious\
than I am gluttonous." Being invited by Taddeo Bernardi, a very rich and\
splendid citizen of Luca, to supper, he went to the house and was shown\
by Taddeo into a chamber hung with silk and paved with fine stones\
representing flowers and foliage of the most beautiful colouring.\
Castruccio gathered some saliva in his mouth and spat it out upon\
Taddeo, and seeing him much disturbed by this, said to him: "I knew not\
where to spit in order to offend thee less." Being asked how Caesar\
died he said: "God willing I will die as he did." Being one night in the\
house of one of his gentlemen where many ladies were assembled, he was\
reproved by one of his friends for dancing and amusing himself with\
them more than was usual in one of his station, so he said: "He who is\
considered wise by day will not be considered a fool at night." A person\
came to demand a favour of Castruccio, and thinking he was not listening\
to his plea threw himself on his knees to the ground, and being sharply\
reproved by Castruccio, said: "Thou art the reason of my acting thus for\
thou hast thy ears in thy feet," whereupon he obtained double the favour\
he had asked. Castruccio used to say that the way to hell was an easy\
one, seeing that it was in a downward direction and you travelled\
blindfolded. Being asked a favour by one who used many superfluous\
words, he said to him: "When you have another request to make, send\
someone else to make it." Having been wearied by a similar man with a\
long oration who wound up by saying: "Perhaps I have fatigued you by\
speaking so long," Castruccio said: "You have not, because I have not\
listened to a word you said." He used to say of one who had been a\
beautiful child and who afterwards became a fine man, that he was\
dangerous, because he first took the husbands from the wives and now he\
took the wives from their husbands. To an envious man who laughed, he\
said: "Do you laugh because you are successful or because another is\
unfortunate?" Whilst he was still in the charge of Messer Francesco\
Guinigi, one of his companions said to him: "What shall I give you if\
you will let me give you a blow on the nose?" Castruccio answered:\
"A helmet." Having put to death a citizen of Lucca who had been\
instrumental in raising him to power, and being told that he had done\
wrong to kill one of his old friends, he answered that people deceived\
themselves; he had only killed a new enemy. Castruccio praised greatly\
those men who intended to take a wife and then did not do so, saying\
that they were like men who said they would go to sea, and then refused\
when the time came. He said that it always struck him with surprise that\
whilst men in buying an earthen or glass vase would sound it first to\
learn if it were good, yet in choosing a wife they were content with\
only looking at her. He was once asked in what manner he would wish to\
be buried when he died, and answered: "With the face turned downwards,\
for I know when I am gone this country will be turned upside down." On\
being asked if it had ever occurred to him to become a friar in order to\
save his soul, he answered that it had not, because it appeared strange\
to him that Fra Lazerone should go to Paradise and Uguccione della\
Faggiuola to the Inferno. He was once asked when should a man eat to\
preserve his health, and replied: "If the man be rich let him eat\
when he is hungry; if he be poor, then when he can." Seeing on of his\
gentlemen make a member of his family lace him up, he said to him: "I\
pray God that you will let him feed you also." Seeing that someone had\
written upon his house in Latin the words: "May God preserve this house\
from the wicked," he said, "The owner must never go in." Passing through\
one of the streets he saw a small house with a very large door, and\
remarked: "That house will fly through the door." He was having a\
discussion with the ambassador of the King of Naples concerning the\
property of some banished nobles, when a dispute arose between them, and\
the ambassador asked him if he had no fear of the king. "Is this king of\
yours a bad man or a good one?" asked Castruccio, and was told that he\
was a good one, whereupon he said, "Why should you suggest that I should\
be afraid of a good man?"\
\
I could recount many other stories of his sayings both witty and\
weighty, but I think that the above will be sufficient testimony to\
his high qualities. He lived forty-four years, and was in every way a\
prince. And as he was surrounded by many evidences of his good fortune,\
so he also desired to have near him some memorials of his bad fortune;\
therefore the manacles with which he was chained in prison are to be\
seen to this day fixed up in the tower of his residence, where they were\
placed by him to testify forever to his days of adversity. As in\
his life he was inferior neither to Philip of Macedon, the father of\
Alexander, nor to Scipio of Rome, so he died in the same year of his\
age as they did, and he would doubtless have excelled both of them had\
Fortune decreed that he should be born, not in Lucca, but in Macedonia\
or Rome.\

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain\
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or\
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual\
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a\
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by\
your equipment.\

\
Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\
\
Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\
people in all walks of life.\
\
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\

\
Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\
Literary Archive Foundation\
\
Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\
status with the IRS.\
\
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\
particular state visit http://pglaf.org\
\
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\
approach us with offers to donate.\
\
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\
\
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\

\
Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\
works.\
\
Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\
\
\
Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\
\
\
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\
\
     http://www.gutenberg.org\
\
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\

Most of the thousands of letters and emails that have been \
sent to me from all over the world are from ordinary men and \
women, but there are also letters from Buddhist monks \
and Christian nuns, from people in prison or facing a life- \
threatening illness or imminent death. Psychotherapists \
have written to say that they recommend the book to their \
patients or incorporate the teachings in their practice. Many \
of those letters and emails mention a lessening or even a \
complete disappearance of suffering and problem-making in \
people's lives as a result of reading The Power of Now and put- \
ting the teachings into practice in everyday life. There is fre- \
quent mention of the amazing and beneficial effects of inner \
body awareness, the sense of freedom that comes from let- \
ting go of self-identification with one's personal history and \

\
life-situation, and a newfound inner peace that arises as one \
learns to relinquish mental/emotional resistance to the \
"suchness" of the present moment. Many people have read \
the book more than once, and they comment that the text \
loses none of its freshness upon subsequent readings, \
indeed that the book's transformative power remains not \
only undiminished, but actually becomes intensified. \
\
The more the dysfunction of the human mind plays itself out \
on the world stage, clearly visible to everyone in the daily tele- \
vision news reports, the greater the number of people who \
realize the urgent need for a radical change in human con- \
sciousness if humanity is not to destroy both itself and the \
planet. This need, as well as readiness in millions of people \
for the arising of a new consciousness, is the context within \
which the "success" of The Power of Now must be seen and \
understood. \
\
This does not mean, of course, that everyone responds favor- \
ably to the book. In many people, as well as in most of the po- \
litical and economic structures and the greater part of the \
media, the old consciousness is still deeply entrenched. \
Anyone who is still totally identified with the voice in their \
head \'97 the stream of involuntary and incessant thinking \'97 \
will inevitably fail to see what The Power of Now is all about. \
Some enthusiastic readers gave a copy of the book to a friend \
or relative and were surprised and disappointed when the \
recipient found it quite meaningless and could not get \
beyond the first few pages. "Mumbo jumbo" was all that Time \
magazine could see in a book that countless people around \
the globe found life-changing. Furthermore, any teaching \
that puts the spotlight of attention on the workings of the ego \
will necessarily provoke egoic reaction, resistance, and attack. \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
However, despite a certain amount of misunderstanding and \
critical dissent, the response to the book around the globe \
has been overwhelmingly positive. I feel confident that in \
the years to come millions more will be drawn to it, and that \
The Power of Now will continue to make a vital contribution \
to the arising of a new consciousness and a more enlight- \
ened humanity. \

INTRODUCTION \
\
\
\
THE ORIGIN OF THIS BOOK \
\
I have little use for the past and rarely think about it; how- \
ever, I would briefly like to tell you how I came to be a spiri- \
tual teacher and how this book came into existence. \
\
Until my thirtieth year, I lived in a state of almost continu- \
ous anxiety interspersed with periods of suicidal depression. \
It feels now as if I am talking about some past lifetime or \
somebody else's life. \
\
One night not long after my twenty-ninth birthday, I woke \
up in the early hours with a feeling of absolute dread. I had \
woken up with such a feeling many times before, but this \
time it was more intense than it had ever been. The silence \
of the night, the vague outlines of the furniture in the dark \
room, the distant noise of a passing train \'97 everything felt \
so alien, so hostile, and so utterly meaningless that it created \
in me a deep loathing of the world. The most loathsome \
thing of all, however, was my own existence. What was the \
point in continuing to live with this burden of misery? Why \
carry on with this continuous struggle? I could feel that a \
deep longing for annihilation, for nonexistence, was now \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
becoming much stronger than the instinctive desire to con- \
tinue to live. \
\
"I cannot live with myself any longer." This was the thought \
that kept repeating itself in my mind. Then suddenly I \
became aware of what a peculiar thought it was. "Am I one \
or two? If I cannot live with myself, there must be two of me: \
the T and the 'self that T cannot live with." "Maybe," I \
thought, "only one of them is real." \
\
I was so stunned by this strange realization that my mind \
stopped. I was fully conscious, but there were no more \
thoughts. Then I felt drawn into what seemed like a vortex of \
energy. It was a slow movement at first and then accelerated. \
I was gripped by an intense fear, and my body started to \
shake. I heard the words "resist nothing," as if spoken inside \
my chest. I could feel myself being sucked into a void. It felt \
as if the void was inside myself rather than outside. Suddenly, \
there was no more fear, and I let myself fall into that void. I \
have no recollection of what happened after that. \
\
I was awakened by the chirping of a bird outside the window. I \
had never heard such a sound before. My eyes were still \
closed, and I saw the image of a precious diamond. Yes, if a \
diamond could make a sound, this is what it would be like. I \
opened my eyes. The first light of dawn was filtering through \
the curtains. Without any thought, I felt, I knew, that there \
is infinitely more to light than we realize. That soft luminos- \
ity filtering through the curtains was love itself. Tears came \
into my eyes. I got up and walked around the room. I recog- \
nized the room, and yet I knew that I had never truly seen it \
before. Everything was fresh and pristine, as if it had just \
come into existence. I picked up things, a pencil, an empty \
bottle, marveling at the beauty and aliveness of it all. \
\
\
\
INTRODUCTION \
\
\
\
That day I walked around the city in utter amazement at the \
miracle of life on earth, as if I had just been born into this \
world. \
\
For the next five months, I lived in a state of uninterrupted \
deep peace and bliss. After that, it diminished somewhat in \
intensity, or perhaps it just seemed to because it became my \
natural state. I could still function in the world, although I \
realized that nothing I ever did could possibly add anything \
to what I already had. \
\
I knew, of course, that something profoundly significant had \
happened to me, but I didn't understand it at all. It wasn't \
until several years later, after I had read spiritual texts and \
spent time with spiritual teachers, that I realized that what \
everybody was looking for had already happened to me. I \
understood that the intense pressure of suffering that night \
must have forced my consciousness to withdraw from its \
identification with the unhappy and deeply fearful self, \
which is ultimately a fiction of the mind. This withdrawal \
must have been so complete that this false, suffering self \
immediately collapsed, just as if a plug had been pulled out \
of an inflatable toy. What was left then was my true nature as \
the ever-present I am: consciousness in its pure state prior to \
identification with form. Later I also learned to go into that \
inner timeless and deathless realm that I had originally per- \
ceived as a void and remain fully conscious. I dwelt in states \
of such indescribable bliss and sacredness that even the origi- \
nal experience I just described pales in comparison. A time \
came when, for a while, I was left with nothing on the physi- \
cal plane. I had no relationships, no job, no home, no socially \
defined identity. I spent almost two years sitting on park \
benches in a state of the most intense joy. \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
But even the most beautiful experiences come and go. More \
fundamental, perhaps, than any experience is the undercur- \
rent of peace that has never left me since then. Sometimes it \
is very strong, almost palpable, and others can feel it too. At \
other times, it is somewhere in the background, like a distant \
melody. \
\
Later, people would occasionally come up to me and say: "I \
want what you have. Can you give it to me, or show me how to \
get it?" And I would say: "You have it already. You just can't \
feel it because your mind is making too much noise." That \
answer later grew into the book that you are holding in your \
hands. \
\
Before I knew it, I had an external identity again. I had \
become a spiritual teacher. \
\
THE TRUTH THAT IS WITHIN YOU \
\
\
\
This book represents the essence of my work, as far as it can \
be conveyed in words, with individuals and small groups of \
spiritual seekers during the past ten years, in Europe and in \
North America. In deep love and appreciation, I would like \
to thank those exceptional people for their courage, their \
willingness to embrace inner change, their challenging ques- \
tions, and their readiness to listen. This book would not have \
come into existence without them. They belong to what is as \
yet a small but fortunately growing minority of spiritual pio- \
neers: people who are reaching a point where they become \
capable of breaking out of inherited collective mind-patterns \
that have kept humans in bondage to suffering for eons. \
\
I trust that this book will find its way to those who are ready \
for such radical inner transformation and so act as a catalyst for \
\

\
it. I also hope that it will reach many others who will find its \
content worthy of consideration, although they may not be \
ready to fully live or practice it. It is possible that at a later \
time, the seed that was sown when reading this book will \
merge with the seed of enlightenment that each human \
being carries within, and suddenly that seed will sprout and \
come alive within them. \
\
\
\
The book in its present form originated, often sponta- \
neously, in response to questions asked by individuals in \
seminars, meditation classes, and private counseling ses- \
sions, and so I have kept the question-and-answer format. I \
learned and received as much in those classes and sessions \
as the questioners. Some of the questions and answers I \
wrote down almost verbatim. Others are generic, which is to \
say I combined certain types of questions that were fre- \
quently asked into one, and extracted the essence from dif- \
ferent answers to form one generic answer. Sometimes, in \
the process of writing, an entirely new answer came that was \
more profound or insightful than anything I had ever \
uttered. Some additional questions were asked by the editor \
so as to provide further clarification of certain points. \
\
You will find that from the first to the last page, the dialogues \
continuously alternate between two different levels. \
\
On one level, I draw your attention to what is false in you. I \
speak of the nature of human unconsciousness and dysfunc- \
tion as well as its most common behavioral manifestations, \
from conflict in relationships to warfare between tribes or \
nations. Such knowledge is vital, for unless you learn to rec- \
ognize the false as false \'97 as not you \'97 there can be no last- \
ing transformation, and you would always end up being \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
drawn back into illusion and into some form of pain. On this \
level, I also show you how not to make that which is false in \
you into a self and into a personal problem, for that is how \
the false perpetuates itself. \
\
On another level, I speak of a profound transformation of \
human consciousness \'97 not as a distant future possibility, \
but available now \'97 no matter who or where you are. You \
are shown how to free yourself from enslavement to the \
mind, enter into this enlightened state of consciousness and \
sustain it in everyday life. \
\
On this level of the book, the words are not always concerned \
with information, but often designed to draw you into this \
new consciousness as you read. Again and again, I endeavor \
to take you with me into that timeless state of intense con- \
scious presence in the Now, so as to give you a taste of en- \
lightenment. Until you are able to experience what I speak \
of, you may find those passages somewhat repetitive. As \
soon as you do, however, I believe you will realize that they \
contain a great deal of spiritual power, and they may become \
for you the most rewarding parts of the book. Moreover, since \
every person carries the seed of enlightenment within, I often \
address myself to the knower in you who dwells behind the \
thinker, the deeper self that immediately recognizes spiritual \
truth, resonates with it, and gains strength from it. \
\
The pause symbol \\ after certain passages is a suggestion \
that you may want to stop reading for a moment, become \
still, and feel and experience the truth of what has just been \
said. There may be other places in the text where you will do \
this naturally and spontaneously. \
\
As you begin reading the book, the meaning of certain \
\
\
\
INTRODUCTION \
\
\
\
words, such as "Being" or "presence," may not be entirely \
clear to you at first. Just read on. Questions or objections \
may occasionally come into your mind as you read. They will \
probably be answered later in the book, or they may turn out \
to be irrelevant as you go more deeply into the teaching \'97 \
and into yourself. \
\
Don't read with the mind only. Watch out for any "feeling- \
response" as you read and a sense of recognition from deep \
within. I cannot tell you any spiritual truth that deep within \
you don't know already. All I can do is remind you of what \
you have forgotten. Living knowledge, ancient and yet ever \
new, is then activated and released from within every cell of \
your body. \
\
The mind always wants to categorize and compare, but this \
book will work better for you if you do not attempt to com- \
pare its terminology with that of other teachings; otherwise, \
you will probably become confused. I use words such as \
"mind," "happiness," and "consciousness" in ways that do \
not necessarily correlate with other teachings. Don't get \
attached to any words. They are only stepping stones, to be \
left behind as quickly as possible. \
\
When I occasionally quote the words of Jesus or the Buddha, \
from A Course in Miracles or from other teachings, I do so \
not in order to compare, but to draw your attention to the fact \
that in essence there is and always has been only one spiritual \
teaching, although it comes in many forms. Some of these \
forms, such as the ancient religions, have become so overlaid \
with extraneous matter that their spiritual essence has \
become almost completely obscured by it. To a large extent, \
therefore, their deeper meaning is no longer recognized and \
their transformative power lost. When I quote from the \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
ancient religions or other teachings, it is to reveal their \
deeper meaning and thereby restore their transformative \
power \'97 particularly for those readers who are followers of \
these religions or teachings. I say to them: there is no need \
to go elsewhere for the truth. Let me show you how to go \
more deeply into what you already have. \
\
Mostly, however, I have endeavored to use terminology that \
is as neutral as possible in order to reach a wide range of \
people. This book can be seen as a restatement for our time \
of that one timeless spiritual teaching, the essence of all reli- \
gions. It is not derived from external sources, but from the \
one true Source within, so it contains no theory or specula- \
tion. I speak from inner experience, and if at times I speak \
forcefully, it is to cut through heavy layers of mental resis- \
tance and to reach that place within you where you already \
know, just as I know, and where the truth is recognized when \
it is heard. There is then a feeling of exaltation and height- \
ened aliveness, as something within you says: "Yes. I know \
this is true." \

CHAPTER ONE \
\
\
\
YOU ARE NOT YOUR MIND \
\
\
\
THE GREATEST OBSTACLE TO ENLIGHTENMENT \
\
Enlightenment \'97 what is that? \
\
A beggar had been sitting by the side of a road for over thirty \
years. One day a stranger walked by. "Spare some change?" \
mumbled the beggar, mechanically holding out his old base- \
ball cap. "I have nothing to give you," said the stranger. Then \
he asked: "What's that you are sitting on?" "Nothing," \
replied the beggar. "Just an old box. I have been sitting on it \
for as long as I can remember." "Ever looked inside?" asked \
the stranger. "No," said the beggar. "What's the point? \
There's nothing in there." "Have a look inside," insisted the \
stranger. The beggar managed to pry open the lid. With \
astonishment, disbelief, and elation, he saw that the box was \
filled with gold. \
\
I am that stranger who has nothing to give you and who \
is telling you to look inside. Not inside any box, as in the \
parable, but somewhere even closer: inside yourself. \
\
"But I am not a beggar," I can hear you say. \
\
\
\
11 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
Those who have not found their true wealth, which is the \
radiant joy of Being and the deep, unshakable peace that \
comes with it, are beggars, even if they have great material \
wealth. They are looking outside for scraps of pleasure or ful- \
fillment, for validation, security, or love, while they have a \
treasure within that not only includes all those things but is \
infinitely greater than anything the world can offer. \
\
The word enlightenment conjures up the idea of some super- \
human accomplishment, and the ego likes to keep it that way, \
but it is simply your natural state of felt oneness with Being. \
It is a state of connectedness with something immeasurable \
and indestructible, something that, almost paradoxically, is \
essentially you and yet is much greater than you. It is finding \
your true nature beyond name and form. The inability to feel \
this connectedness gives rise to the illusion of separation, \
from yourself and from the world around you. You then per- \
ceive yourself, consciously or unconsciously, as an isolated \
fragment. Fear arises, and conflict within and without \
becomes the norm. \
\
I love the Buddha's simple definition of enlightenment as \
"the end of suffering." There is nothing superhuman in that, \
is there? Of course, as a definition, it is incomplete. It only \
tells you what enlightenment is not: no suffering. But what's \
left when there is no more suffering? The Buddha \
is silent on that, and his silence implies that you'll have to \
find out for yourself. He uses a negative definition so that \
the mind cannot make it into something to believe in or into \
a superhuman accomplishment, a goal that is impossible \
for you to attain. Despite this precaution, the majority of \
Buddhists still believe that enlightenment is for the Buddha, \
not for them, at least not in this lifetime. \
\
\
\
12 \
\
\
\
YOU ARE NOT YOUR MIND \
\
You used the word Being. Can you explain what you mean by \
that? \
\
Being is the eternal, ever-present One Life beyond the myriad \
forms of life that are subject to birth and death. However, \
Being is not only beyond but also deep within every form as its \
innermost invisible and indestructible essence. This means \
that it is accessible to you now as your own deepest self, your \
true nature. But don't seek to grasp it with your mind. Don't \
try to understand it. You can know it only when the mind is \
still. When you are present, when your attention is fully and \
intensely in the Now, Being can be felt, but it can never be \
understood mentally. To regain awareness of Being and to \
abide in that state of "feeling-realization" is enlightenment. \
\
\
\
When you say Being, are you talking about God? If you are, \
then why don't you say it? \
\
The word God has become empty of meaning through thou- \
sands of years of misuse. I use it sometimes, but I do so \
sparingly. By misuse, I mean that people who have never \
even glimpsed the realm of the sacred, the infinite vastness \
behind that word, use it with great conviction, as if they \
knew what they are talking about. Or they argue against it, as \
if they knew what it is that they are denying. This misuse \
gives rise to absurd beliefs, assertions, and egoic delusions, \
such as "My or our God is the only true God, and your God is \
false," or Nietzsche's famous statement "God is dead." \
\
\
\
13 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
The word God has become a closed concept. The moment \
the word is uttered, a mental image is created, no longer, per- \
haps, of an old man with a white beard, but still a mental repre- \
sentation of someone or something outside you, and, yes, \
almost inevitably a male someone or something. \
\
Neither God nor Being nor any other word can define or \
explain the ineffable reality behind the word, so the only \
important question is whether the word is a help or a hin- \
drance in enabling you to experience That toward which it \
points. Does it point beyond itself to that transcendental real- \
ity, or does it lend itself too easily to becoming no more than \
an idea in your head that you believe in, a mental idol? \
\
The word Being explains nothing, but nor does God. Being, \
however, has the advantage that it is an open concept. It does not \
reduce the infinite invisible to a finite entity. It is impossible to \
form a mental image of it. Nobody can claim exclusive posses- \
sion of Being. It is your very essence, and it is immediately acces- \
sible to you as the feeling of your own presence, the realization \
I am that is prior to I am this or I am that. So it is only a small \
step from the word Being to the experience of Being. \
\
\
\
What is the greatest obstacle to experiencing this reality? \
\
Identification with your mind, which causes thought to \
become compulsive. Not to be able to stop thinking is a \
dreadful affliction, but we don't realize this because almost \
everybody is suffering from it, so it is considered normal. \
\
\
\
14 \
\
\
\
YOU ARE NOT YOUR MIND \
\
This incessant mental noise prevents you from finding that \
realm of inner stillness that is inseparable from Being. It \
also creates a false mind-made self that casts a shadow of \
fear and suffering. We will look at all that in more detail \
later. \
\
The philosopher Descartes believed that he had found the \
most fundamental truth when he made his famous state- \
ment: "I think, therefore I am." He had, in fact, given expres- \
sion to the most basic error: to equate thinking with Being \
and identity with thinking. The compulsive thinker, which \
means almost everyone, lives in a state of apparent separate- \
ness, in an insanely complex world of continuous problems \
and conflict, a world that reflects the ever-increasing frag- \
mentation of the mind. Enlightenment is a state of whole- \
ness, of being "at one" and therefore at peace. At one with \
life in its manifested aspect, the world, as well as with your \
deepest self and life unmanifested \'97 at one with Being. \
Enlightenment is not only the end of suffering and of contin- \
uous conflict within and without, but also the end of the \
dreadful enslavement to incessant thinking. What an incred- \
ible liberation this is! \
\
Identification with your mind creates an opaque screen of con- \
cepts, labels, images, words, judgments, and definitions that \
blocks all true relationship. It comes between you and yourself, \
between you and your fellow man and woman, between you \
and nature, between you and God. It is this screen of thought \
that creates the illusion of separateness, the illusion that there \
is you and a totally separate "other." You then forget the essen- \
tial fact that, underneath the level of physical appearances and \
separate forms, you are one with all that is. By "forget," I mean \
that you can no longer feel this oneness as self-evident reality. \
\
\
\
15 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
You may believe it to be true, but you no longer know it to be \
true. A belief may be comforting. Only through your own expe- \
rience, however, does it become liberating. \
\
Thinking has become a disease. Disease happens when \
things get out of balance. For example, there is nothing \
wrong with cells dividing and multiplying in the body, but \
when this process continues in disregard of the total organ- \
ism, cells proliferate and we have disease. \
\
The mind is a superb instrument if used rightly. Used \
wrongly, however, it becomes very destructive. To put it \
more accurately, it is not so much that you use your mind \
wrongly \'97 you usually don't use it at all. It uses you. This \
is the disease. You believe that you are your mind. This is \
the delusion. The instrument has taken you over. \
\
I don't quite agree. It is true that I do a lot of aimless think- \
ing, like most people, but I can still choose to use my mind to \
get and accomplish things, and I do that all the time. \
\
Just because you can solve a crossword puzzle or build an \
atom bomb doesn't mean that you use your mind. Just as \
dogs love to chew bones, the mind loves to get its teeth into \
problems. That's why it does crossword puzzles and builds \
atom bombs. You have no interest in either. Let me ask you \
this: can you be free of your mind whenever you want to? \
Have you found the "off button? \
\
You mean stop thinking altogether? No, I can't, except maybe \
for a moment or two. \
\
Then the mind is using you. You are unconsciously identified \
\
\
\
16 \
\
\
\
YOU ARE NOT YOUR MIND \
\
\
\
with it, so you don't even know that you are its slave. It's \
almost as if you were possessed without knowing it, and so \
you take the possessing entity to be yourself. The beginning \
of freedom is the realization that you are not the possessing \
entity \'97 the thinker. Knowing this enables you to observe \
the entity. The moment you start watching the thinker, a \
higher level of consciousness becomes activated. You then \
begin to realize that there is a vast realm of intelligence \
beyond thought, that thought is only a tiny aspect of that intel- \
ligence. You also realize that all the things that truly matter \'97 \
beauty, love, creativity, joy, inner peace \'97 arise from beyond \
the mind. You begin to awaken. \
\
\
\
FREEING YOURSELF FROM YOUR MIND \
\
What exactly do you mean by "watching the thinker"? \
\
When someone goes to the doctor and says, "I hear a voice in \
my head," he or she will most likely be sent to a psychiatrist. \
The fact is that, in a very similar way, virtually everyone hears \
a voice, or several voices, in their head all the time: the invol- \
untary thought processes that you don't realize you have the \
power to stop. Continuous monologues or dialogues. \
\
You have probably come across "mad" people in the street \
incessantly talking or muttering to themselves. Well, that's \
not much different from what you and all other "normal" \
people do, except that you don't do it out loud. The voice \
comments, speculates, judges, compares, complains, likes, \
\
\
\
17 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
dislikes, and so on. The voice isn't necessarily relevant to \
the situation you find yourself in at the time; it may be \
reviving the recent or distant past or rehearsing or imagin- \
ing possible future situations. Here it often imagines \
things going wrong and negative outcomes; this is called \
worry. Sometimes this soundtrack is accompanied by visual \
images or "mental movies." Even if the voice is relevant to \
the situation at hand, it will interpret it in terms of the past. \
This is because the voice belongs to your conditioned mind, \
which is the result of all your past history as well as of the \
collective cultural mind-set you inherited. So you see and \
judge the present through the eyes of the past and get a \
totally distorted view of it. It is not uncommon for the voice \
to be a person's own worst enemy. Many people live with a \
tormentor in their head that continuously attacks and pun- \
ishes them and drains them of vital energy. It is the cause \
of untold misery and unhappiness, as well as of disease. \
\
The good news is that you can free yourself from your mind. \
This is the only true liberation. You can take the first step \
right now. Start listening to the voice in your head as often \
as you can. Pay particular attention to any repetitive thought \
patterns, those old gramophone records that have been play- \
ing in your head perhaps for many years. This is what I \
mean by "watching the thinker," which is another way of \
saying: listen to the voice in your head, be there as the wit- \
nessing presence. \
\
When you listen to that voice, listen to it impartially. That is \
to say, do not judge. Do not judge or condemn what you \
hear, for doing so would mean that the same voice has come \
in again through the back door. You'll soon realize: there is \
the voice, and here I am listening to it, watching it. This I am \
\
\
\
18 \
\
\
\
YOU ARE NOT YOUR MIND \
\
\
\
realization, this sense of your own presence, is not a thought. \
It arises from beyond the mind. \
\
\
\
So when you listen to a thought, you are aware not only of \
the thought but also of yourself as the witness of the thought. \
A new dimension of consciousness has come in. As you lis- \
ten to the thought, you feel a conscious presence \'97 your \
deeper self \'97 behind or underneath the thought, as it were. \
The thought then loses its power over you and quickly sub- \
sides, because you are no longer energizing the mind \
through identification with it. This is the beginning of the \
end of involuntary and compulsive thinking. \
\
When a thought subsides, you experience a discontinuity in \
the mental stream \'97 a gap of "no-mind." At first, the gaps \
will be short, a few seconds perhaps, but gradually they will \
become longer. When these gaps occur, you feel a certain \
stillness and peace inside you. This is the beginning of your \
natural state of felt oneness with Being, which is usually \
obscured by the mind. With practice, the sense of stillness \
and peace will deepen. In fact, there is no end to its depth. \
You will also feel a subtle emanation of joy arising from deep \
within: the joy of Being. \
\
It is not a trancelike state. Not at all. There is no loss of con- \
sciousness here. The opposite is the case. If the price of peace \
were a lowering of your consciousness, and the price of still- \
ness a lack of vitality and alertness, then they would not be \
worth having. In this state of inner connectedness, you are \
\
\
\
19 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
much more alert, more awake than in the mind-identified \
state. You are fully present. It also raises the vibrational fre- \
quency of the energy field that gives life to the physical body. \
\
As you go more deeply into this realm of no-mind, as it is \
sometimes called in the East, you realize the state of pure \
consciousness. In that state, you feel your own presence with \
such intensity and such joy that all thinking, all emotions, \
your physical body, as well as the whole external world \
become relatively insignificant in comparison to it. And yet \
this is not a selfish but a selfless state. It takes you beyond \
what you previously thought of as "your self." That presence \
is essentially you and at the same time inconceivably greater \
than you. What I am trying to convey here may sound para- \
doxical or even contradictory, but there is no other way that \
I can express it. \
\
\
\
Instead of "watching the thinker," you can also create a gap \
in the mind stream simply by directing the focus of your \
attention into the Now. Just become intensely conscious \
of the present moment. This is a deeply satisfying thing to \
do. In this way, you draw consciousness away from mind \
activity and create a gap of no-mind in which you are highly \
alert and aware but not thinking. This is the essence of med- \
itation. \
\
In your everyday life, you can practice this by taking any rou- \
tine activity that normally is only a means to an end and giv- \
ing it your fullest attention, so that it becomes an end in \
\
\
\
20 \
\
\
\
YOU ARE NOT YOUR MIND \
\
\
\
itself. For example, every time you walk up and down the \
stairs in your house or place of work, pay close attention to \
every step, every movement, even your breathing. Be totally \
present. Or when you wash your hands, pay attention to all \
the sense perceptions associated with the activity: the sound \
and feel of the water, the movement of your hands, the scent \
of the soap, and so on. Or when you get into your car, after \
you close the door, pause for a few seconds and observe the \
flow of your breath. Become aware of a silent but powerful \
sense of presence. There is one certain criterion by which \
you can measure your success in this practice: the degree of \
peace that you feel within. \
\
\
\
So the single most vital step on your journey toward enlight- \
enment is this: learn to disidentify from your mind. Every \
time you create a gap in the stream of mind, the light of your \
consciousness grows stronger. \
\
One day you may catch yourself smiling at the voice in your \
head, as you would smile at the antics of a child. This means \
that you no longer take the content of your mind all that seri- \
ously, as your sense of self does not depend on it. \
\
ENLIGHTENMENT: RISING ABOVE THOUGHT \
\
Isn't thinking essential in order to survive in this world? \
\
Your mind is an instrument, a tool. It is there to be used for \
a specific task, and when the task is completed, you lay it \
\
\
\
21 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
down. As it is, I would say about 80 to 90 percent of most \
people's thinking is not only repetitive and useless, but \
because of its dysfunctional and often negative nature, much \
of it is also harmful. Observe your mind and you will find \
this to be true. It causes a serious leakage of vital energy. \
\
This kind of compulsive thinking is actually an addiction. \
What characterizes an addiction? Quite simply this: you no \
longer feel that you have the choice to stop. It seems stronger \
than you. It also gives you a false sense of pleasure, pleasure \
that invariably turns into pain. \
\
Why should we be addicted to thinking? \
\
Because you are identified with it, which means that you \
derive your sense of self from the content and activity of your \
mind. Because you believe that you would cease to be if you \
stopped thinking. As you grow up, you form a mental image \
of who you are, based on your personal and cultural condi- \
tioning. We may call this phantom self the ego. It consists of \
mind activity and can only be kept going through constant \
thinking. The term ego means different things to different \
people, but when I use it here it means a false self, created \
by unconscious identification with the mind. \
\
To the ego, the present moment hardly exists. Only past and \
future are considered important. This total reversal of the \
truth accounts for the fact that in the ego mode the mind is \
so dysfunctional. It is always concerned with keeping the \
past alive, because without it \'97 who are you? It constantly \
projects itself into the future to ensure its continued survival \
and to seek some kind of release or fulfillment there. It says: \
"One day, when this, that, or the other happens, I am going \
\
\
\
22 \
\
\
\
YOU ARE NOT YOUR MIND \
\
to be okay, happy, at peace." Even when the ego seems to be \
concerned with the present, it is not the present that it sees: \
It misperceives it completely because it looks at it through the \
eyes of the past. Or it reduces the present to a means to an end, \
an end that always lies in the mind-projected future. Observe \
your mind and you'll see that this is how it works. \
\
The present moment holds the key to liberation. But you \
cannot find the present moment as long as you are your \
mind. \
\
I don't want to lose my ability to analyze and discriminate. I \
wouldn't mind learning to think more clearly, in a more \
focused way, but I don't want to lose my mind. The gift of \
thought is the most precious thing we have. Without it, we \
would just be another species of animal. \
\
The predominance of mind is no more than a stage in the \
evolution of consciousness. We need to go on to the next \
stage now as a matter of urgency; otherwise, we will be \
destroyed by the mind, which has grown into a monster. I \
will talk about this in more detail later. Thinking and con- \
sciousness are not synonymous. Thinking is only a small \
aspect of consciousness. Thought cannot exist without con- \
sciousness, but consciousness does not need thought. \
\
Enlightenment means rising above thought, not falling back \
to a level below thought, the level of an animal or a plant. In \
the enlightened state, you still use your thinking mind when \
needed, but in a much more focused and effective way than \
before. You use it mostly for practical purposes, but you are \
free of the involuntary internal dialogue, and there is inner \
stillness. When you do use your mind, and particularly when \
\
\
\
23 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
a creative solution is needed, you oscillate every few minutes \
or so between thought and stillness, between mind and no- \
mind. No-mind is consciousness without thought. Only in \
that way is it possible to think creatively, because only in that \
way does thought have any real power. Thought alone, when \
it is no longer connected with the much vaster realm of con- \
sciousness, quickly becomes barren, insane, destructive. \
\
The mind is essentially a survival machine. Attack and \
defense against other minds, gathering, storing, and analyz- \
ing information \'97 this is what it is good at, but it is not \
at all creative. All true artists, whether they know it or not, \
create from a place of no-mind, from inner stillness. The \
mind then gives form to the creative impulse or insight. Even \
the great scientists have reported that their creative break- \
throughs came at a time of mental quietude. The surprising \
result of a nationwide inquiry among America's most emi- \
nent mathematicians, including Einstein, to find out their \
working methods, was that thinking "plays only a subordinate \
part in the brief, decisive phase of the creative act itself." 1 So \
I would say that the simple reason why the majority of scien- \
tists are not creative is not because they don't know how to \
think but because they don't know how to stop thinking! \
\
It wasn't through the mind, through thinking, that the mir- \
acle that is life on earth or your body was created and is being \
sustained. There is clearly an intelligence at work that is far \
greater than the mind. How can a single human cell meas- \
uring 1/1,000 of an inch in diameter contain instructions \
within its DNA that would fill 1,000 books of 600 pages \
each? The more we learn about the workings of the body, the \
more we realize just how vast is the intelligence at work \
within it and how little we know. When the mind reconnects \
\
\
\
24 \
\
\
\
YOU ARE NOT YOUR MIND \
\
with that, it becomes a most wonderful tool. It then serves \
something greater than itself. \
\
EMOTION: THE BODY'S REACTION TO YOUR MIND \
\
What about emotions? I get caught up in my emotions more \
than I do in my mind. \
\
Mind, in the way I use the word, is not just thought. It \
includes your emotions as well as all unconscious mental- \
emotional reactive patterns. Emotion arises at the place \
where mind and body meet. It is the body's reaction to your \
mind \'97 or you might say, a reflection of your mind in \
the body. For example, an attack thought or a hostile \
thought will create a buildup of energy in the body that we \
call anger. The body is getting ready to fight. The thought \
that you are being threatened, physically or psychologically, \
causes the body to contract, and this is the physical side of \
what we call fear. Research has shown that strong emotions \
even cause changes in the biochemistry of the body. These \
biochemical changes represent the physical or material \
aspect of the emotion. Of course, you are not usually con- \
scious of all your thought patterns, and it is often only \
through watching your emotions that you can bring them \
into awareness. \
\
The more you are identified with your thinking, your likes \
and dislikes, judgments and interpretations, which is to say \
the less present you are as the watching consciousness, the \
stronger the emotional energy charge will be, whether you \
are aware of it or not. If you cannot feel your emotions, if \
you are cut off from them, you will eventually experience \
them on a purely physical level, as a physical problem or \
\
\
\
25 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
symptom. A great deal has been written about this in recent \
years, so we don't need to go into it here. A strong uncon- \
scious emotional pattern may even manifest as an external \
event that appears to just happen to you. For example, I have \
observed that people who carry a lot of anger inside without \
being aware of it and without expressing it are more likely \
to be attacked, verbally or even physically, by other angry \
people, and often for no apparent reason. They have a strong \
emanation of anger that certain people pick up subliminally \
and that triggers their own latent anger. \
\
If you have difficulty feeling your emotions, start by focusing \
attention on the inner energy field of your body. Feel the \
body from within. This will also put you in touch with your \
emotions. We will explore this in more detail later. \
\
\
\
You say that an emotion is the mind's reflection in the body. But \
sometimes there is a conflict between the two: the mind says \
"no" while the emotion says "yes, " or the other way around. \
\
If you really want to know your mind, the body will always \
give you a truthful reflection, so look at the emotion, or \
rather feel it in your body. If there is an apparent conflict \
between them, the thought will be the lie, the emotion will \
be the truth. Not the ultimate truth of who you are, but the \
relative truth of your state of mind at that time. \
\
Conflict between surface thoughts and unconscious mental \
processes is certainly common. You may not yet be able to \
\
\
\
26 \
\
\
\
YOU ARE NOT YOUR MIND \
\
\
\
bring your unconscious mind activity into awareness as \
thoughts, but it will always be reflected in the body as an emo- \
tion, and of this you can become aware. To watch an emotion \
in this way is basically the same as listening to or watching a \
thought, which I described earlier. The only difference is that, \
while a thought is in your head, an emotion has a strong phys- \
ical component and so is primarily felt in the body. You can \
then allow the emotion to be there without being controlled by \
it. You no longer are the emotion; you are the watcher, the \
observing presence. If you practice this, all that is unconscious \
in you will be brought into the light of consciousness. \
\
So observing our emotions is as important as observing our \
thoughts? \
\
Yes. Make it a habit to ask yourself: What's going on inside \
me at this moment? That question will point you in the right \
direction. But don't analyze, just watch. Focus your attention \
within. Feel the energy of the emotion. If there is no emotion \
present, take your attention more deeply into the inner energy \
field of your body. It is the doorway into Being. \
\
\
\
An emotion usually represents an amplified and energized \
thought pattern, and because of its often overpowering ener- \
getic charge, it is not easy initially to stay present enough to be \
able to watch it. It wants to take you over, and it usually suc- \
ceeds \'97 unless there is enough presence in you. If you are \
pulled into unconscious identification with the emotion \
\
\
\
27 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
through lack of presence, which is normal, the emotion tem- \
porarily becomes "you." Often a vicious circle builds up be- \
tween your thinking and the emotion: they feed each other. The \
thought pattern creates a magnified reflection of itself in \
the form of an emotion, and the vibrational frequency of the \
emotion keeps feeding the original thought pattern. By dwelling \
mentally on the situation, event, or person that is the perceived \
cause of the emotion, the thought feeds energy to the emotion, \
which in turn energizes the thought pattern, and so on. \
\
Basically, all emotions are modifications of one primordial, \
undifferentiated emotion that has its origin in the loss of \
awareness of who you are beyond name and form. Because \
of its undifferentiated nature, it is hard to find a name that \
precisely describes this emotion. "Fear" comes close, but \
apart from a continuous sense of threat, it also includes a \
deep sense of abandonment and incompleteness. It may be \
best to use a term that is as undifferentiated as that basic \
emotion and simply call it "pain." One of the main tasks of \
the mind is to fight or remove that emotional pain, which is \
one of the reasons for its incessant activity, but all it can ever \
achieve is to cover it up temporarily. In fact, the harder the \
mind struggles to get rid of the pain, the greater the pain. \
The mind can never find the solution, nor can it afford to \
allow you to find the solution, because it is itself an intrinsic \
part of the "problem." Imagine a chief of police trying to find \
an arsonist when the arsonist is the chief of police. You will \
not be free of that pain until you cease to derive your sense \
of self from identification with the mind, which is to say \
from ego. The mind is then toppled from its place of power \
and Being reveals itself as your true nature. \
\
Yes, I know what you are going to ask. \
\
\
\
28 \
\
\
\
YOU ARE NOT YOUR MIND \
\
\
\
J was going to ask: What about positive emotions such as love \
and joy? \
\
They are inseparable from your natural state of inner connect- \
edness with Being. Glimpses of love and joy or brief mo- \
ments of deep peace are possible whenever a gap occurs in \
the stream of thought. For most people, such gaps happen \
rarely and only accidentally, in moments when the mind is \
rendered "speechless," sometimes triggered by great beauty, \
extreme physical exertion, or even great danger. Suddenly, \
there is inner stillness. And within that stillness there is a \
subtle but intense joy, there is love, there is peace. \
\
Usually, such moments are short-lived, as the mind quickly \
resumes its noise-making activity that we call thinking. Love, \
joy, and peace cannot flourish until you have freed yourself \
from mind dominance. But they are not what I would call \
emotions. They lie beyond the emotions, on a much deeper \
level. So you need to become fully conscious of your emotions \
and be able to feel them before you can feel that which lies \
beyond them. Emotion literally means "disturbance." The \
word comes from the Latin emovere, meaning "to disturb." \
\
Love, joy, and peace are deep states of Being, or rather three \
aspects of the state of inner connectedness with Being. As \
such, they have no opposite. This is because they arise from \
beyond the mind. Emotions, on the other hand, being part of \
the dualistic mind, are subject to the law of opposites. This \
simply means that you cannot have good without bad. So in \
the unenlightened, mind-identified condition, what is some- \
times wrongly called joy is the usually short-lived pleasure \
side of the continuously alternating pain/pleasure cycle. \
Pleasure is always derived from something outside you, \
\
\
\
29 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
whereas joy arises from within. The very thing that gives you \
pleasure today will give you pain tomorrow, or it will leave \
you, so its absence will give you pain. And what is often \
referred to as love may be pleasurable and exciting for a \
while, but it is an addictive clinging, an extremely needy con- \
dition that can turn into its opposite at the flick of a switch. \
Many "love" relationships, after the initial euphoria has \
passed, actually oscillate between "love" and hate, attraction \
and attack. \
\
Real love doesn't make you suffer. How could it? It doesn't \
suddenly turn into hate, nor does real joy turn into pain. As \
I said, even before you are enlightened \'97 before you have \
freed yourself from your mind \'97 you may get glimpses of \
true joy, true love, or of a deep inner peace, still but vibrantly \
alive. These are aspects of your true nature, which is usually \
obscured by the mind. Even within a "normal" addictive rela- \
tionship, there can be moments when the presence of some- \
thing more genuine, something incorruptible, can be felt. \
But they will only be glimpses, soon to be covered up again \
through mind interference. It may then seem that you had \
something very precious and lost it, or your mind may con- \
vince you that it was all an illusion anyway. The truth is that \
it wasn't an illusion, and you cannot lose it. It is part of your \
natural state, which can be obscured but can never be \
destroyed by the mind. Even when the sky is heavily overcast, \
the sun hasn't disappeared. It's still there on the other side \
of the clouds. \
\
The Buddha says that pain or suffering arises through desire \
or craving and that to be free of pain we need to cut the bonds \
of desire. \
\
\
\
30 \
\
\
\
YOU ARE NOT YOUR MIND \
\
All cravings are the mind seeking salvation or fulfillment in \
external things and in the future as a substitute for the joy of \
Being. As long as I am my mind, I am those cravings, those \
needs, wants, attachments, and aversions, and apart from \
them there is no "I" except as a mere possibility, an unful- \
filled potential, a seed that has not yet sprouted. In that state, \
even my desire to become free or enlightened is just another \
craving for fulfillment or completion in the future. So don't \
seek to become free of desire or "achieve" enlightenment. \
Become present. Be there as the observer of the mind. \
Instead of quoting the Buddha, be the Buddha, be "the awak- \
ened one," which is what the word buddha means. \
\
Humans have been in the grip of pain for eons, ever since \
they fell from the state of grace, entered the realm of time \
and mind, and lost awareness of Being. At that point, they \
started to perceive themselves as meaningless fragments in \
an alien universe, unconnected to the Source and to each \
other. \
\
Pain is inevitable as long as you are identified with your \
mind, which is to say as long as you are unconscious, spiri- \
tually speaking. I am talking here primarily of emotional \
pain, which is also the main cause of physical pain and \
physical disease. Resentment, hatred, self-pity, guilt, anger, \
depression, jealousy, and so on, even the slightest irritation, \
are all forms of pain. And every pleasure or emotional high \
contains within itself the seed of pain: its inseparable oppo- \
site, which will manifest in time. \
\
Anybody who has ever taken drugs to get "high" will know \
that the high eventually turns into a low, that the pleasure \
turns into some form of pain. Many people also know from \
\
\
\
31 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
their own experience how easily and quickly an intimate rela- \
tionship can turn from a source of pleasure to a source of \
pain. Seen from a higher perspective, both the negative and \
the positive polarities are faces of the same coin, are both \
part of the underlying pain that is inseparable from the \
mind-identified egoic state of consciousness. \
\
There are two levels to your pain: the pain that you create \
now, and the pain from the past that still lives on in your \
mind and body. Ceasing to create pain in the present and \
dissolving past pain \'97 this is what I want to talk about now. \

\
CHAPTER TWO \
\
\
\
CONSCIOUSNESS: \
THE WAY OUT OF PAIN \
\
\
\
CREATE NO MORE PAIN IN THE PRESENT \
\
Nobody's life is entirely free of pain and sorrow. Isn't it a ques- \
tion of learning to live with them rather than trying to avoid \
them? \
\
The greater part of human pain is unnecessary. It is self- \
created as long as the unobserved mind runs your life. \
\
The pain that you create now is always some form of nonac- \
ceptance, some form of unconscious resistance to what is. \
On the level of thought, the resistance is some form of judg- \
ment. On the emotional level, it is some form of negativity. \
The intensity of the pain depends on the degree of resistance \
to the present moment, and this in turn depends on how \
strongly you are identified with your mind. The mind always \
seeks to deny the Now and to escape from it. In other words, \
the more you are identified with your mind, the more you \
suffer. Or you may put it like this: the more you are able to \
honor and accept the Now, the more you are free of pain, of \
suffering \'97 and free of the egoic mind. \
\
\
\
33 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
Why does the mind habitually deny or resist the Now? \
Because it cannot function and remain in control without \
time, which is past and future, so it perceives the timeless \
Now as threatening. Time and mind are in fact inseparable. \
\
Imagine the Earth devoid of human life, inhabited only by \
plants and animals. Would it still have a past and a future? \
Could we still speak of time in any meaningful way? The \
question "What time is it?" or "What's the date today?" \'97 if \
anybody were there to ask it \'97 would be quite meaningless. \
The oak tree or the eagle would be bemused by such a ques- \
tion. "What time?" they would ask. "Well, of course, it's now. \
The time is now. What else is there?" \
\
Yes, we need the mind as well as time to function in this \
world, but there comes a point where they take over our lives, \
and this is where dysfunction, pain, and sorrow set in. \
\
The mind, to ensure that it remains in control, seeks contin- \
uously to cover up the present moment with past and future, \
and so, as the vitality and infinite creative potential of Being, \
which is inseparable from the Now, becomes covered up by \
time, your true nature becomes obscured by the mind. An \
increasingly heavy burden of time has been accumulating in \
the human mind. All individuals are suffering under this \
burden, but they also keep adding to it every moment when- \
ever they ignore or deny that precious moment or reduce it \
to a means of getting to some future moment, which only \
exists in the mind, never in actuality. The accumulation of \
time in the collective and individual human mind also holds \
a vast amount of residual pain from the past. \
\
If you no longer want to create pain for yourself and others, if \
you no longer want to add to the residue of past pain that still \
\
\
\
34 \
\
\
\
CONSCIOUSNESS: THE WAY OUT OF PAIN \
\
lives on in you, then don't create any more time, or at least \
no more than is necessary to deal with the practical aspects \
of your life. How to stop creating time? Realize deeply that \
the present moment is all you ever have. Make the Now the \
primary focus of your life. Whereas before you dwelt in time \
and paid brief visits to the Now, have your dwelling place in \
the Now and pay brief visits to past and future when required \
to deal with the practical aspects of your life situation. \
Always say "yes" to the present moment. What could be \
more futile, more insane, than to create inner resistance \
to something that already is? What could be more insane \
than to oppose life itself, which is now and always now? \
Surrender to what is. Say "yes" to life \'97 and see how life sud- \
denly starts working for you rather than against you. \
\
\
\
The present moment is sometimes unacceptable, unpleasant, \
or awful. \
\
It is as it is. Observe how the mind labels it and how this \
labeling process, this continuous sitting in judgment, cre- \
ates pain and unhappiness. By watching the mechanics of \
the mind, you step out of its resistance patterns, and you can \
then allow the present moment to be. This will give you a taste \
of the state of inner freedom from external conditions, the \
state of true inner peace. Then see what happens, and take \
action if necessary or possible. \
\
Accept \'97 then act. Whatever the present moment contains, \
accept it as if you had chosen it. Always work with it, not \
\
\
\
35 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
against it. Make it your friend and ally, not your enemy. This \
will miraculously transform your whole life. \
\
\
\
PAST PAIN: DISSOLVING THE PAIN-BODY \
\
As long as you are unable to access the power of the Now, \
every emotional pain that you experience leaves behind a \
residue of pain that lives on in you. It merges with the pain \
from the past, which was already there, and becomes lodged \
in your mind and body. This, of course, includes the pain \
you suffered as a child, caused by the unconsciousness of the \
world into which you were born. \
\
This accumulated pain is a negative energy field that occu- \
pies your body and mind. If you look on it as an invisible \
entity in its own right, you are getting quite close to the truth. \
It's the emotional pain-body. It has two modes of being: dor- \
mant and active. A pain-body may be dormant 90 percent of \
the time; in a deeply unhappy person, though, it may be \
active up to 100 percent of the time. Some people live almost \
entirely through their pain-body, while others may experi- \
ence it only in certain situations, such as intimate relation- \
ships, or situations linked with past loss or abandonment, \
physical or emotional hurt, and so on. Anything can trigger \
it, particularly if it resonates with a pain pattern from your \
past. When it is ready to awaken from its dormant stage, \
even a thought or an innocent remark made by someone \
close to you can activate it. \
\
\
\
36 \
\
\
\
CONSCIOUSNESS: THE WAY OUT OF PAIN \
\
Some pain-bodies are obnoxious but relatively harmless, for \
example like a child who won't stop whining. Others are vicious \
and destructive monsters, true demons. Some are physically \
violent; many more are emotionally violent. Some will attack \
people around you or close to you, while others may attack you, \
their host. Thoughts and feelings you have about your life then \
become deeply negative and self-destructive. Illnesses and acci- \
dents are often created in this way. Some pain-bodies drive \
their hosts to suicide. \
\
When you thought you knew a person and then you are sud- \
denly confronted with this alien, nasty creature for the first \
time, you are in for quite a shock. However, it's more impor- \
tant to observe it in yourself than in someone else. Watch out \
for any sign of unhappiness in yourself, in whatever form \'97 \
it may be the awakening pain-body. This can take the form \
of irritation, impatience, a somber mood, a desire to hurt, \
anger, rage, depression, a need to have some drama in your \
relationship, and so on. Catch it the moment it awakens \
from its dormant state. \
\
The pain-body wants to survive, just like every other entity \
in existence, and it can only survive if it gets you to uncon- \
sciously identify with it. It can then rise up, take you over, \
"become you," and live through you. It needs to get its \
"food" through you. It will feed on any experience that res- \
onates with its own kind of energy, anything that creates \
further pain in whatever form: anger, destructiveness, \
hatred, grief, emotional drama, violence, and even illness. \
So the pain-body, when it has taken you over, will create a \
situation in your life that reflects back its own energy fre- \
quency for it to feed on. Pain can only feed on pain. Pain \
cannot feed on joy. It finds it quite indigestible. \
\
\
\
37 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
Once the pain-body has taken you over, you want more pain. \
You become a victim or a perpetrator. You want to inflict \
pain, or you want to suffer pain, or both. There isn't really \
much difference between the two. You are not conscious of \
this, of course, and will vehemently claim that you do not \
want pain. But look closely and you will find that your think- \
ing and behavior are designed to keep the pain going, for \
yourself and others. If you were truly conscious of it, the pat- \
tern would dissolve, for to want more pain is insanity, and \
nobody is consciously insane. \
\
The pain-body, which is the dark shadow cast by the ego, is \
actually afraid of the light of your consciousness. It is afraid \
of being found out. Its survival depends on your unconscious \
identification with it, as well as on your unconscious fear of \
facing the pain that lives in you. But if you don't face it, if you \
don't bring the light of your consciousness into the pain, \
you will be forced to relive it again and again. The pain-body \
may seem to you like a dangerous monster that you cannot \
bear to look at, but I assure you that it is an insubstantial phan- \
tom that cannot prevail against the power of your presence. \
\
Some spiritual teachings state that all pain is ultimately an \
illusion, and this is true. The question is: Is it true for you? A \
mere belief doesn't make it true. Do you want to experience \
pain for the rest of your life and keep saying that it is an illu- \
sion? Does that free you from the pain? What we are con- \
cerned with here is how you can realize this truth \'97 that is, \
make it real in your own experience. \
\
So the pain-body doesn't want you to observe it directly and \
see it for what it is. The moment you observe it, feel its energy \
field within you, and take your attention into it, the identifi- \
cation is broken. A higher dimension of consciousness has \
\
\
\
38 \
\
\
\
CONSCIOUSNESS: THE WAY OUT OF PAIN \
\
come in. I call it presence. You are now the witness or the \
watcher of the pain-body. This means that it cannot use you \
anymore by pretending to be you, and it can no longer replen- \
ish itself through you. You have found your own innermost \
strength. You have accessed the power of Now. \
\
What happens to the pain-body when we become conscious enough \
to break our identification with it? \
\
Unconsciousness creates it; consciousness transmutes it \
into itself. St. Paul expressed this universal principle beauti- \
fully: "Everything is shown up by being exposed to the light, \
and whatever is exposed to the light itself becomes light." \
Just as you cannot fight the darkness, you cannot fight the \
pain-body. Trying to do so would create inner conflict and \
thus further pain. Watching it is enough. Watching it \
implies accepting it as part of what is at that moment. \
\
The pain-body consists of trapped life-energy that has split \
off from your total energy field and has temporarily become \
autonomous through the unnatural process of mind identi- \
fication. It has turned in on itself and become anti-life, like \
an animal trying to devour its own tail. Why do you think our \
civilization has become so life-destructive? But even the life- \
destructive forces are still life-energy. \
\
When you start to disidentify and become the watcher, the \
pain-body will continue to operate for a while and will try to \
trick you into identifying with it again. Although you are no \
longer energizing it through your identification, it has a cer- \
tain momentum, just like a spinning wheel that will keep \
turning for a while even when it is no longer being pro- \
pelled. At this stage, it may also create physical aches and \
\
\
\
39 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
pains in different parts of the body, but they won't last. Stay \
present, stay conscious. Be the ever-alert guardian of your \
inner space. You need to be present enough to be able to \
watch the pain-body directly and feel its energy. It then can- \
not control your thinking. The moment your thinking is \
aligned with the energy field of the pain-body, you are identi- \
fied with it and again feeding it with your thoughts. \
\
For example, if anger is the predominant energy vibration of \
the pain-body and you think angry thoughts, dwelling on \
what someone did to you or what you are going to do to him \
or her, then you have become unconscious, and the pain- \
body has become "you." Where there is anger, there is \
always pain underneath. Or when a dark mood comes upon \
you and you start getting into a negative mind-pattern and \
thinking how dreadful your life is, your thinking has become \
aligned with the pain-body, and you have become uncon- \
scious and vulnerable to the pain-body's attack. \
"Unconscious," the way that I use the word here, means to \
be identified with some mental or emotional pattern. It \
implies a complete absence of the watcher. \
\
Sustained conscious attention severs the link between the \
pain-body and your thought processes and brings about \
the process of transmutation. It is as if the pain becomes fuel \
for the flame of your consciousness, which then burns more \
brightly as a result. This is the esoteric meaning of the \
ancient art of alchemy: the transmutation of base metal into \
gold, of suffering into consciousness. The split within is \
healed, and you become whole again. Your responsibility \
then is not to create further pain. \
\
Let me summarize the process. Focus attention on the feeling \
inside you. Know that it is the pain-body. Accept that it is \
\
\
\

\
CONSCIOUSNESS: THE WAY OUT OF PAIN \
\
there. Don't think about it \'97 don't let the feeling turn into \
thinking. Don't judge or analyze. Don't make an identity \
for yourself out of it. Stay present, and continue to be the \
observer of what is happening inside you. Become aware not \
only of the emotional pain but also of "the one who observes," \
the silent watcher. This is the power of the Now, the power of \
your own conscious presence. Then see what happens. \
\
\
\
For many women, the pain-body awakens particularly at the \
time preceding the menstrual flow. I will talk about this and \
the reason for it in more detail later. Right now, let me just \
say this: If you are able to stay alert and present at that time \
and watch whatever you feel within, rather than be taken \
over by it, it affords an opportunity for the most powerful \
spiritual practice, and a rapid transmutation of all past pain \
becomes possible. \
\
EGO IDENTIFICATION WITH THE PAIN-BODY \
\
The process that I have just described is profoundly power- \
ful yet simple. It could be taught to a child, and hopefully one \
day it will be one of the first things children learn in school. \
Once you have understood the basic principle of being pres- \
ent as the watcher of what happens inside you \'97 and you \
"understand" it by experiencing it \'97 you have at your dis- \
posal the most potent transformational tool. \
\
This is not to deny that you may encounter intense inner \
resistance to disidentifying from your pain. This will be the \
\
\
\
41 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
case particularly if you have lived closely identified with your \
emotional pain-body for most of your life and the whole or a \
large part of your sense of self is invested in it. What this \
means is that you have made an unhappy self out of your \
pain-body and believe that this mind-made fiction is who you \
are. In that case, unconscious fear of losing your identity will \
create strong resistance to any disidentification. In other \
words, you would rather be in pain \'97 be the pain-body \'97 \
than take a leap into the unknown and risk losing the famil- \
iar unhappy self. \
\
If this applies to you, observe the resistance within yourself. \
Observe the attachment to your pain. Be very alert. Observe \
the peculiar pleasure you derive from being unhappy. Ob- \
serve the compulsion to talk or think about it. The resistance \
will cease if you make it conscious. You can then take your \
attention into the pain-body, stay present as the witness, and \
so initiate its transmutation. \
\
Only you can do this. Nobody can do it for you. But if you \
are fortunate enough to find someone who is intensely con- \
scious, if you can be with them and join them in the state of \
presence, that can be helpful and will accelerate things. In \
this way, your own light will quickly grow stronger. When a \
log that has only just started to burn is placed next to one \
that is burning fiercely, and after a while they are separated \
again, the first log will be burning with much greater inten- \
sity. After all, it is the same fire. To be such a fire is one of \
the functions of a spiritual teacher. Some therapists may \
also be able to fulfill that function, provided that they have \
gone beyond the level of mind and can create and sustain a \
state of intense conscious presence while they are working \
with you. \
\
\
\

\
\
\
CONSCIOUSNESS: THE WAY OUT OF PAIN \
\
THE ORIGIN OF FEAR \
\
You mentioned fear as being part of our basic underlying emo- \
tional pain. How does fear arise, and why is there so much of \
it in people's lives? And isn't a certain amount of fear just \
healthy self-protection? If I didn't have a fear of fire, I might \
put my hand in it and get burned. \
\
The reason why you don't put your hand in the fire is not \
because of fear, it's because you know that you'll get burned. \
You don't need fear to avoid unnecessary danger \'97 just a \
minimum of intelligence and common sense. For such prac- \
tical matters, it is useful to apply the lessons learned in the \
past. Now if someone threatened you with fire or with physi- \
cal violence, you might experience something like fear. This \
is an instinctive shrinking back from danger, but not the psy- \
chological condition of fear that we are talking about here. \
The psychological condition of fear is divorced from any con- \
crete and true immediate danger. It comes in many forms: \
unease, worry, anxiety, nervousness, tension, dread, phobia, \
and so on. This kind of psychological fear is always of some- \
thing that might happen, not of something that is happening \
now. You are in the here and now, while your mind is in the \
future. This creates an anxiety gap. And if you are identified \
with your mind and have lost touch with the power and sim- \
plicity of the Now, that anxiety gap will be your constant \
companion. You can always cope with the present moment, \
but you cannot cope with something that is only a mind pro- \
jection \'97 you cannot cope with the future. \
\
Moreover, as long as you are identified with your mind, the \
ego runs your life, as I pointed out earlier. Because of its \
phantom nature, and despite elaborate defense mechanisms, \
\
\
\
43 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
the ego is very vulnerable and insecure, and it sees itself as \
constantly under threat. This, by the way, is the case even if \
the ego is outwardly very confident. Now remember that an \
emotion is the body's reaction to your mind. What message \
is the body receiving continuously from the ego, the false, \
mind-made self? Danger, I am under threat. And what is the \
emotion generated by this continuous message? Fear, of \
course. \
\
Fear seems to have many causes. Fear of loss, fear of failure, \
fear of being hurt, and so on, but ultimately all fear is the \
ego's fear of death, of annihilation. To the ego, death is \
always just around the corner. In this mind-identified state, \
fear of death affects every aspect of your life. For example, \
even such a seemingly trivial and "normal" thing as the com- \
pulsive need to be right in an argument and make the other \
person wrong \'97 defending the mental position with which \
you have identified \'97 is due to the fear of death. If you iden- \
tify with a mental position, then if you are wrong, your mind- \
based sense of self is seriously threatened with annihilation. \
So you as the ego cannot afford to be wrong. To be wrong is \
to die. Wars have been fought over this, and countless rela- \
tionships have broken down. \
\
Once you have disidentified from your mind, whether you \
are right or wrong makes no difference to your sense of self \
at all, so the forcefully compulsive and deeply unconscious \
need to be right, which is a form of violence, will no longer \
be there. You can state clearly and firmly how you feel or \
what you think, but there will be no aggressiveness or defen- \
siveness about it. Your sense of self is then derived from a \
deeper and truer place within yourself, not from the mind. \
Watch out for any kind of defensiveness within yourself. \
\
\
\
44 \
\
\
\
CO N SCIO US N E S S : T H E WAY OUT OF PAIN \
\
What are you defending? An illusory identity, an image in \
your mind, a fictitious entity. By making this pattern con- \
scious, by witnessing it, you disidentify from it. In the light \
of your consciousness, the unconscious pattern will then \
quickly dissolve. This is the end of all arguments and power \
games, which are so corrosive to relationships. Power over \
others is weakness disguised as strength. True power is \
within, and it is available to you now. \
\
So anyone who is identified with their mind and, therefore, \
disconnected from their true power, their deeper self rooted \
in Being, will have fear as their constant companion. The \
number of people who have gone beyond mind is as yet \
extremely small, so you can assume that virtually everyone \
you meet or know lives in a state of fear. Only the intensity \
of it varies. It fluctuates between anxiety and dread at one \
end of the scale and a vague unease and distant sense of \
threat at the other. Most people become conscious of it only \
when it takes on one of its more acute forms. \
\
THE EGO'S SEARCH FOR WHOLENESS \
\
Another aspect of the emotional pain that is an intrinsic part \
of the egoic mind is a deep-seated sense of lack or incomplete- \
ness, of not being whole. In some people, this is conscious, in \
others unconscious. If it is conscious, it manifests as the \
unsettling and constant feeling of not being worthy or good \
enough. If it is unconscious, it will only be felt indirectly as an \
intense craving, wanting and needing. In either case, people \
will often enter into a compulsive pursuit of ego-gratification \
and things to identify with in order to fill this hole they feel \
within. So they strive after possessions, money, success, \
power, recognition, or a special relationship, basically so that \
\
\
\
45 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
they can feel better about themselves, feel more complete. \
But even when they attain all these things, they soon find that \
the hole is still there, that it is bottomless. Then they are really \
in trouble, because they cannot delude themselves anymore. \
Well, they can and do, but it gets more difficult. \
\
As long as the egoic mind is running your life, you cannot \
truly be at ease; you cannot be at peace or fulfilled except for \
brief intervals when you obtained what you wanted, when \
a craving has just been fulfilled. Since the ego is a derived \
sense of self, it needs to identify with external things. It needs \
to be both defended and fed constantly. The most common \
ego identifications have to do with possessions, the work you \
do, social status and recognition, knowledge and education, \
physical appearance, special abilities, relationships, personal \
and family history, belief systems, and often also political, \
nationalistic, racial, religious, and other collective identifica- \
tions. None of these is you. \
\
Do you find this frightening? Or is it a relief to know this? All \
of these things you will have to relinquish sooner or later. \
Perhaps you find it as yet hard to believe, and I am certainly \
not asking you to believe that your identity cannot be found \
in any of those things. You will know the truth of it for your- \
self. You will know it at the latest when you feel death \
approaching. Death is a stripping away of all that is not you. \
The secret of life is to "die before you die" \'97 and find that \
there is no death. \

CHAPTER THREE \
\
\
\
MOVING DEEPLY \
INTO THE NOW \
\
\
\
DON'T SEEK YOUR SELF IN THE MIND \
\
I feel that there is still a great deal I need to learn about the \
workings of my mind before I can get anywhere near full con- \
sciousness or spiritual enlightenment. \
\
No, you don't. The problems of the mind cannot be solved \
on the level of the mind. Once you have understood the basic \
dysfunction, there isn't really much else that you need to \
learn or understand. Studying the complexities of the mind \
may make you a good psychologist, but doing so won't take \
you beyond the mind, just as the study of madness isn't \
enough to create sanity. You have already understood the \
basic mechanics of the unconscious state: identification with \
the mind, which creates a false self, the ego, as a substitute \
for your true self rooted in Being. You become as a "branch \
cut off from the vine," as Jesus puts it. \
\
The ego's needs are endless. It feels vulnerable and threat- \
ened and so lives in a state of fear and want. Once you know \
how the basic dysfunction operates, there is no need to \
explore all its countless manifestations, no need to make it \
\
\
\
47 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
into a complex personal problem. The ego, of course, loves \
that. It is always seeking for something to attach itself to in \
order to uphold and strengthen its illusory sense of self, and \
it will readily attach itself to your problems. This is why, for \
so many people, a large part of their sense of self is intimately \
connected with their problems. Once this has happened, the \
last thing they want is to become free of them; that would \
mean loss of self. There can be a great deal of unconscious \
ego investment in pain and suffering. \
\
So once you recognize the root of unconsciousness as identi- \
fication with the mind, which of course includes the emo- \
tions, you step out of it. You become present. When you are \
present, you can allow the mind to be as it is without getting \
entangled in it. The mind in itself is not dysfunctional. It is \
a wonderful tool. Dysfunction sets in when you seek your \
self in it and mistake it for who you are. It then becomes the \
egoic mind and takes over your whole life. \
\
END THE DELUSION OF TIME \
\
It seems almost impossible to disidentify from the mind. We \
are all immersed in it. How do you teach a fish to fly? \
\
Here is the key: End the delusion of time. Time and mind \
are inseparable. Remove time from the mind and it stops \'97 \
unless you choose to use it. \
\
To be identified with your mind is to be trapped in time: the \
compulsion to live almost exclusively through memory and \
anticipation. This creates an endless preoccupation with past \
and future and an unwillingness to honor and acknowledge \
the present moment and allow it to he. The compulsion \
\
\
\
48 \
\
\
\
MOVING DEEPLY INTO THE NOW \
\
arises because the past gives you an identity and the future \
holds the promise of salvation, of fulfillment in whatever \
form. Both are illusions. \
\
But without a sense of time, how would we function in this \
world? There would be no goals to strive toward anymore. I \
wouldn't even know who I am, because my past makes me who \
I am today. I think time is something very precious, and we \
need to learn to use it wisely rather than waste it. \
\
Time isn't precious at all, because it is an illusion. What you \
perceive as precious is not time but the one point that is out of \
time: the Now. That is precious indeed. The more you are \
focused on time \'97 past and future \'97 the more you miss the \
Now, the most precious thing there is. \
\
Why is it the most precious thing? Firstly, because it is the \
only thing. It's all there is. The eternal present is the space \
within which your whole life unfolds, the one factor that \
remains constant. Life is now. There was never a time when \
your life was not now, nor will there ever be. Secondly, the \
Now is the only point that can take you beyond the limited \
confines of the mind. It is your only point of access into the \
timeless and formless realm of Being. \
\
\
\
NOTHING EXISTS OUTSIDE THE NOW \
\
Aren't past and future just as real, sometimes even more real, \
than the present? After all, the past determines who we are, as \
\
\
\
49 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
well as how we perceive and behave in the present. And our \
future goals determine which actions we take in the present. \
\
You haven't yet grasped the essence of what I am saying \
because you are trying to understand it mentally. The mind \
cannot understand this. Only you can. Please just listen. \
\
Have you ever experienced, done, thought, or felt anything \
outside the Now? Do you think you ever will? Is it possible \
for anything to happen or be outside the Now? The answer is \
obvious, is it not? \
\
Nothing ever happened in the past; it happened in the Now. \
\
Nothing will ever happen in the future; it will happen in \
the Now. \
\
What you think of as the past is a memory trace, stored in \
the mind, of a former Now. When you remember the past, \
you reactivate a memory trace \'97 and you do so now. The \
future is an imagined Now, a projection of the mind. When \
the future comes, it comes as the Now. When you think \
about the future, you do it now. Past and future obviously \
have no reality of their own. Just as the moon has no light \
of its own, but can only reflect the light of the sun, so are \
past and future only pale reflections of the light, power, and \
reality of the eternal present. Their reality is "borrowed" \
from the Now. \
\
The essence of what I am saying here cannot be understood \
by the mind. The moment you grasp it, there is a shift in \
consciousness from mind to Being, from time to presence. \
Suddenly, everything feels alive, radiates energy, emanates \
Being. \
\
\
\
50 \
\
\
\
MOVING DEEPLY INTO THE NOW \
\
\
\
THE KEY TO THE SPIRITUAL DIMENSION \
\
In life-threatening emergency situations, the shift in con- \
sciousness from time to presence sometimes happens \
naturally. The personality that has a past and a future momen- \
tarily recedes and is replaced by an intense conscious \
presence, very still but very alert at the same time. What- \
ever response is needed then arises out of that state of con- \
sciousness. \
\
The reason why some people love to engage in dangerous \
activities, such as mountain climbing, car racing, and so on, \
although they may not be aware of it, is that it forces them \
into the Now \'97 that intensely alive state that is free of time, \
free of problems, free of thinking, free of the burden of the \
personality. Slipping away from the present moment even \
for a second may mean death. Unfortunately, they come to \
depend on a particular activity to be in that state. But you \
don't need to climb the north face of the Eiger. You can enter \
that state now. \
\
\
\
Since ancient times, spiritual masters of all traditions have \
pointed to the Now as the key to the spiritual dimension. \
\
\
\
51 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
Despite this, it seems to have remained a secret. It is \
certainly not taught in churches and temples. If you go to \
a church, you may hear readings from the Gospels such \
as "Take no thought for the morrow; for the morrow shall \
take thought for the things of itself," or "Nobody who puts \
his hands to the plow and looks back is fit for the King- \
dom of God." Or you might hear the passage about the \
beautiful flowers that are not anxious about tomorrow but \
live with ease in the timeless Now and are provided for \
abundantly by God. The depth and radical nature of these \
teachings are not recognized. No one seems to realize that \
they are meant to be lived and so bring about a profound \
inner transformation. \
\
\
\
The whole essence of Zen consists in walking along the \
razor's edge of Now \'97 to be so utterly, so completely present \
that no problem, no suffering, nothing that is not who you \
are in your essence, can survive in you. In the Now, in the \
absence of time, all your problems dissolve. Suffering needs \
time; it cannot survive in the Now. \
\
The great Zen master Rinzai, in order to take his students' \
attention away from time, would often raise his finger and \
slowly ask: "What, at this moment, is lacking?" A power- \
ful question that does not require an answer on the level of \
the mind. It is designed to take your attention deeply into the \
Now. A similar question in the Zen tradition is this: "If not \
now, when?" \
\
\
\
52 \
\
\
\
MOVING DEEPLY INTO THE NOW \
\
\
\
The Now is also central to the teaching of Sufism, the mysti- \
cal branch of Islam. Sufis have a saying: "The Sufi is the son \
of time present." And Rumi, the great poet and teacher of \
Sufism, declares: "Past and future veil God from our sight; \
burn up both of them with fire." \
\
Meister Eckhart, the thirteenth-century spiritual teacher, \
summed it all up beautifully: "Time is what keeps the light \
from reaching us. There is no greater obstacle to God than \
time." \
\
\
\
ACCESSING THE POWER OF THE NOW \
\
A moment ago, when you talked about the eternal present and \
the unreality of past and future, I found myself looking at that \
tree outside the window. I had looked at it a few times before, \
but this time it was different. The external perception had not \
changed much, except that the colors seemed brighter and \
more vibrant. But there was now an added dimension to it. \
This is hard to explain. I don't know how, but I was aware of \
something invisible that I felt was the essence of that tree, its \
inner spirit, if you like. And somehow I was part of that. I \
realize now that I hadn't truly seen the tree before, just aflat \
\
\
\
53 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
and dead image of it. When I look at the tree now, some of \
that awareness is still present, hut I can feel it slipping away. \
You see, the experience is already receding into the past. Can \
something like this ever be more than a fleeting glimpse? \
\
You were free of time for a moment. You moved into the \
Now and therefore perceived the tree without the screen of \
mind. The awareness of Being became part of your percep- \
tion. With the timeless dimension comes a different kind of \
knowing, one that does not "kill" the spirit that lives within \
every creature and every thing. A knowing that does not \
destroy the sacredness and mystery of life but contains a \
deep love and reverence for all that is. A knowing of which \
the mind knows nothing. \
\
The mind cannot know the tree. It can only know facts or \
information about the tree. My mind cannot know you, only \
labels, judgments, facts, and opinions about you. Being \
alone knows directly. \
\
There is a place for mind and mind knowledge. It is in the \
practical realm of day-to-day living. However, when it takes \
over all aspects of your life, including your relationships with \
other human beings and with nature, it becomes a monstrous \
parasite that, unchecked, may well end up killing all life on the \
planet and finally itself by killing its host. \
\
You have had a glimpse of how the timeless can transform \
your perceptions. But an experience is not enough, no mat- \
ter how beautiful or profound. What is needed and what we \
are concerned with is a permanent shift in consciousness. \
\
So break the old pattern of present-moment denial and present- \
moment resistance. Make it your practice to withdraw attention \
\
\
\
54 \
\
\
\
MOVING DEEPLY INTO THE NOW \
\
from past and future whenever they are not needed. Step \
out of the time dimension as much as possible in everyday \
life. If you find it hard to enter the Now directly, start by \
observing the habitual tendency of your mind to want to \
escape from the Now. You will observe that the future is \
usually imagined as either better or worse than the present. \
If the imagined future is better, it gives you hope or pleas- \
urable anticipation. If it is worse, it creates anxiety. Both are \
illusory. Through self-observation, more presence comes into \
your life automatically. The moment you realize you are not \
present, you are present. Whenever you are able to observe \
your mind, you are no longer trapped in it. Another factor \
has come in, something that is not of the mind: the witness- \
ing presence. \
\
Be present as the watcher of your mind \'97 of your thoughts \
and emotions as well as your reactions in various situations. \
Be at least as interested in your reactions as in the situation \
or person that causes you to react. Notice also how often your \
attention is in the past or future. Don't judge or analyze what \
you observe. Watch the thought, feel the emotion, observe \
the reaction. Don't make a personal problem out of them. \
You will then feel something more powerful than any of \
those things that you observe: the still, observing presence \
itself behind the content of your mind, the silent watcher. \
\
\
\
Intense presence is needed when certain situations trigger a \
reaction with a strong emotional charge, such as when your \
self-image is threatened, a challenge comes into your life that \
\
\
\
55 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
triggers fear, things "go wrong," or an emotional complex \
from the past is brought up. In those instances, the tendency \
is for you to become "unconscious." The reaction or emotion \
takes you over \'97 you "become" it. You act it out. You justify, \
make wrong, attack, defend. . .except that it isn't you, it's the \
reactive pattern, the mind in its habitual survival mode. \
\
Identification with the mind gives it more energy; observa- \
tion of the mind withdraws energy from it. Identification \
with the mind creates more time; observation of the mind \
opens up the dimension of the timeless. The energy that is \
withdrawn from the mind turns into presence. Once you can \
feel what it means to be present, it becomes much easier to \
simply choose to step out of the time dimension whenever \
time is not needed for practical purposes and move more \
deeply into the Now. This does not impair your ability to use \
time \'97 past or future \'97 when you need to refer to it for \
practical matters. Nor does it impair your ability to use your \
mind. In fact, it enhances it. When you do use your mind, it \
will be sharper, more focused. \
\
LETTING GO OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TIME \
\
Learn to use time in the practical aspects of your life \'97 we may \
call this "clock time" \'97 but immediately return to present- \
moment awareness when those practical matters have been \
dealt with. In this way, there will be no buildup of "psycho- \
logical time," which is identification with the past and con- \
tinuous compulsive projection into the future. \
\
Clock time is not just making an appointment or planning a \
trip. It includes learning from the past so that we don't repeat \
the same mistakes over and over. Setting goals and working \
\
\
\
56 \
\
\
\
MOVING DEEPLY INTO THE NOW \
\
toward them. Predicting the future by means of patterns and \
laws, physical, mathematical and so on, learned from the past \
and taking appropriate action on the basis of our predictions. \
\
But even here, within the sphere of practical living, where we \
cannot do without reference to past and future, the present \
moment remains the essential factor: Any lesson from the \
past becomes relevant and is applied now. Any planning as \
well as working toward achieving a particular goal is done now. \
\
The enlightened person's main focus of attention is always \
the Now, but they are still peripherally aware of time. In \
other words, they continue to use clock time but are free of \
psychological time. \
\
Be alert as you practice this so that you do not unwittingly \
transform clock time into psychological time. For example, if \
you made a mistake in the past and learn from it now, you \
are using clock time. On the other hand, if you dwell on it \
mentally, and self-criticism, remorse, or guilt come up, then \
you are making the mistake into "me" and "mine": You \
make it part of your sense of self, and it has become psycho- \
logical time, which is always linked to a false sense of iden- \
tity. Nonforgiveness necessarily implies a heavy burden of \
psychological time. \
\
If you set yourself a goal and work toward it, you are using \
clock time. You are aware of where you want to go, but you \
honor and give your fullest attention to the step that you are \
taking at this moment. If you then become excessively \
focused on the goal, perhaps because you are seeking happi- \
ness, fulfillment, or a more complete sense of self in it, the \
Now is no longer honored. It becomes reduced to a mere \
stepping stone to the future, with no intrinsic value. Clock \
\
\
\
57 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
time then turns into psychological time. Your life's journey \
is no longer an adventure, just an obsessive need to arrive, to \
attain, to "make it." You no longer see or smell the flowers \
by the wayside either, nor are you aware of the beauty and \
the miracle of life that unfolds all around you when you are \
present in the Now. \
\
\
\
I can see the supreme importance of the Now, but I cannot \
quite go along with you when you say that time is a complete \
illusion. \
\
When I say "time is an illusion," my intention is not to make \
a philosophical statement. I am just reminding you of a \
simple fact \'97 a fact so obvious that you may find it hard to \
grasp and may even find it meaningless \'97 but once fully \
realized, it can cut like a sword through all the mind-created \
layers of complexity and "problems." Let me say it again: the \
present moment is all you ever have. There is never a time \
when your life is not "this moment." Is this not a fact? \
\
THE INSANITY OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TIME \
\
You will not have any doubt that psychological time is a men- \
tal disease if you look at its collective manifestations. They \
occur, for example, in the form of ideologies such as commu- \
nism, national socialism or any nationalism, or rigid religious \
belief systems, which operate under the implicit assumption \
that the highest good lies in the future and that therefore the \
\
\
\
58 \
\
\
\
MOVING DEEPLY INTO THE NOW \
\
end justifies the means. The end is an idea, a point in the \
mind-projected future, when salvation in whatever form \'97 \
happiness, fulfillment, equality, liberation, and so on \'97 will \
be attained. Not infrequently, the means of getting there \
are the enslavement, torture, and murder of people in the \
present. \
\
For example, it is estimated that as many as fifty million \
people were murdered to further the cause of communism, to \
bring about a "better world" in Russia, China, and other coun- \
tries. 2 This is a chilling example of how belief in a future \
heaven creates a present hell. Can there be any doubt that psy- \
chological time is a serious and dangerous mental illness? \
\
How does this mind pattern operate in your life? Are you \
always trying to get somewhere other than where you are? Is \
most of your doing just a means to an end? Is fulfillment \
always just around the corner or confined to short-lived \
pleasures, such as sex, food, drink, drugs, or thrills and \
excitement? Are you always focused on becoming, achieving, \
and attaining, or alternatively chasing some new thrill or \
pleasure? Do you believe that if you acquire more things you \
will become more fulfilled, good enough, or psychologically \
complete? Are you waiting for a man or woman to give \
meaning to your life? \
\
In the normal, mind-identified or unenlightened state of \
consciousness, the power and infinite creative potential that \
lie concealed in the Now are completely obscured by psycho- \
logical time. Your life then loses its vibrancy, its freshness, \
its sense of wonder. The old patterns of thought, emotion, \
behavior, reaction, and desire are acted out in endless repeat \
performances, a script in your mind that gives you an iden- \
tity of sorts but distorts or covers up the reality of the Now. \
\
\
\
59 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
The mind then creates an obsession with the future as an \
escape from the unsatisfactory present. \
\
NEGATIVITY AND SUFFERING HAVE THEIR ROOTS \
IN TIME \
\
But the belief that the future will be better than the present is \
not always an illusion. The present can be dreadful, and \
things can get better in the future, and often they do. \
\
Usually, the future is a replica of the past. Superficial changes \
are possible, but real transformation is rare and depends \
upon whether you can become present enough to dissolve \
the past by accessing the power of the Now. What you per- \
ceive as future is an intrinsic part of your state of conscious- \
ness now. If your mind carries a heavy burden of past, you \
will experience more of the same. The past perpetuates it- \
self through lack of presence. The quality of your conscious- \
ness at this moment is what shapes the future \'97 which, of \
course, can only be experienced as the Now. \
\
You may win ten million dollars, but that kind of change is no \
more than skin deep. You would simply continue to act out the \
same conditioned patterns in more luxurious surroundings. \
Humans have learned to split the atom. Instead of killing ten \
or twenty people with a wooden club, one person can now kill \
a million just by pushing a button. Is that real change? \
\
If it is the quality of your consciousness at this moment that \
determines the future, then what is it that determines the \
quality of your consciousness? Your degree of presence. So \
the only place where true change can occur and where the \
past can be dissolved is the Now. \
\
\
\
60 \
\
\
\
MOVING DEEPLY INTO THE NOW \
\
\
\
All negativity is caused by an accumulation of psychological \
time and denial of the present. Unease, anxiety, tension, \
stress, worry \'97 all forms of fear \'97 are caused by too much \
future, and not enough presence. Guilt, regret, resentment, \
grievances, sadness, bitterness, and all forms of nonforgive- \
ness are caused by too much past, and not enough presence. \
Most people find it difficult to believe that a state of con- \
sciousness totally free of all negativity is possible. And yet \
this is the liberated state to which all spiritual teachings \
point. It is the promise of salvation, not in an illusory future \
but right here and now. \
\
You may find it hard to recognize that time is the cause of \
your suffering or your problems. You believe that they are \
caused by specific situations in your life, and seen from a \
conventional viewpoint, this is true. But until you have dealt \
with the basic problem-making dysfunction of the mind \'97 \
its attachment to past and future and denial of the Now \
\'97 problems are actually interchangeable. If all your prob- \
lems or perceived causes of suffering or unhappiness were \
miraculously removed for you today, but you had not \
become more present, more conscious, you would soon find \
yourself with a similar set of problems or causes of suffering, \
like a shadow that follows you wherever you go. Ultimately, \
there is only one problem: the time-bound mind itself. \
\
I cannot believe that I could ever reach a point where I am \
completely free of my problems. \
\
\
\
61 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
You are right. You can never reach that point because you are \
at that point now. \
\
There is no salvation in time. You cannot be free in the \
future. Presence is the key to freedom, so you can only be free \
now. \
\
\
\
FINDING THE LIFE UNDERNEATH YOUR LIFE SITUATION \
\
I don't see how I can be free now. As it happens, I am extremely \
unhappy with my life at the moment. This is a fact, and I \
would be deluding myself if I tried to convince myself that all is \
well when it definitely isn't. To me, the present moment is very \
unhappy; it is not liberating at all. What keeps me going is the \
hope or possibility of some improvement in the future. \
\
You think that your attention is in the present moment when \
it's actually taken up completely by time. You cannot be both \
unhappy and fully present in the Now. \
\
What you refer to as your "life" should more accurately be \
called your "life situation." It is psychological time: past and \
future. Certain things in the past didn't go the way you \
wanted them to go. You are still resisting what happened in \
the past, and now you are resisting what is. Hope is what \
keeps you going, but hope keeps you focused on the future, \
and this continued focus perpetuates your denial of the \
Now and therefore your unhappiness. \
\
It is true that my present life situation is the result of things \
that happened in the past, but it is still my present situation, \
and being stuck in it is what makes me unhappy. \
\
Forget about your life situation for a while and pay attention to \
\
62 \
\
\
\
MOVING DEEPLY INTO THE NOW \
\
your life. \
\
What is the difference? \
\
Your life situation exists in time. \
\
Your life is now. \
\
Your life situation is mind-stuff. \
\
Your life is real. \
\
Find the "narrow gate that leads to life." It is called the Now. \
Narrow your life down to this moment. Your life situation \
may be full of problems \'97 most life situations are \'97 but \
find out if you have any problem at this moment. Not \
tomorrow or in ten minutes, but now. Do you have a prob- \
lem now? \
\
When you are full of problems, there is no room for anything \
new to enter, no room for a solution. So whenever you can, \
make some room, create some space, so that you find the life \
underneath your life situation. \
\
Use your senses fully. Be where you are. Look around. Just \
look, don't interpret. See the light, shapes, colors, textures. \
Be aware of the silent presence of each thing. Be aware of the \
space that allows everything to be. Listen to the sounds; don't \
judge them. Listen to the silence underneath the sounds. \
Touch something \'97 anything \'97 and feel and acknowledge \
its Being. Observe the rhythm of your breathing; feel the air \
flowing in and out, feel the life energy inside your body. \
Allow everything to be, within and without. Allow the \
"isness" of all things. Move deeply into the Now. \
\
You are leaving behind the deadening world of mental abstrac- \
tion, of time. You are getting out of the insane mind that is \
\
\
\
63 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
draining you of life energy, just as it is slowly poisoning and \
destroying the Earth. You are awakening out of the dream of \
time into the present. \
\
\
\
ALL PROBLEMS ARE ILLUSIONS OF THE MIND \
\
It feels as if a heavy burden has been lifted. A sense of light- \
ness. I feel clear.. . but my problems are still there waiting for \
me, aren't they? They haven't been solved. Am I not just tem- \
porarily evading them? \
\
If you found yourself in paradise, it wouldn't be long before \
your mind would say "yes, but. ..." Ultimately, this is not \
about solving your problems. It's about realizing that there \
are no problems. Only situations \'97 to be dealt with now, or \
to be left alone and accepted as part of the "isness" of the \
present moment until they change or can be dealt with. \
Problems are mind-made and need time to survive. They \
cannot survive in the actuality of the Now. \
\
Focus your attention on the Now and tell me what problem \
you have at this moment. \
\
\
\
I am not getting any answer because it is impossible to have \
a problem when your attention is fully in the Now. A situa- \
\
\
\
64 \
\
\
\
MOVING DEEPLY INTOTHE NOW \
\
tion that needs to be either dealt with or accepted \'97 yes. \
Why make it into a problem? Why make anything into a \
problem? Isn't life challenging enough as it is? What do you \
need problems for? The mind unconsciously loves problems \
because they give you an identity of sorts. This is normal, \
and it is insane. "Problem" means that you are dwelling on \
a situation mentally without there being a true intention or \
possibility of taking action now and that you are uncon- \
sciously making it part of your sense of self. You become so \
overwhelmed by your life situation that you lose your sense \
of life, of Being. Or you are carrying in your mind the insane \
burden of a hundred things that you will or may have to do \
in the future instead of focusing your attention on the one \
thing that you can do now. \
\
When you create a problem, you create pain. All it takes is a \
simple choice, a simple decision: no matter what happens, I \
will create no more pain for myself. I will create no more prob- \
lems. Although it is a simple choice, it is also very radical. You \
won't make that choice unless you are truly fed up with suffer- \
ing, unless you have truly had enough. And you won't be able \
to go through with it unless you access the power of the Now. \
If you create no more pain for yourself, then you create no \
more pain for others. You also no longer contaminate the \
beautiful Earth, your inner space, and the collective human \
psyche with the negativity of problem-making. \
\
\
\
If you have ever been in a life-or-death emergency situation, \
you will know that it wasn't a problem. The mind didn't have \
\
\
\
65 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
time to fool around and make it into a problem. In a true \
emergency, the mind stops; you become totally present in \
the Now, and something infinitely more powerful takes over. \
This is why there are many reports of ordinary people sud- \
denly becoming capable of incredibly courageous deeds. In \
any emergency, either you survive or you don't. Either way, \
it is not a problem. \
\
Some people get angry when they hear me say that prob- \
lems are illusions. I am threatening to take away their \
sense of who they are. They have invested much time in a \
false sense of self. For many years, they have uncon- \
sciously defined their whole identity in terms of their prob- \
lems or their suffering. Who would they be without it? \
\
A great deal of what people say, think, or do is actually moti- \
vated by fear, which of course is always linked with having \
your focus on the future and being out of touch with the Now. \
As there are no problems in the Now, there is no fear either. \
\
Should a situation arise that you need to deal with now, your \
action will be clear and incisive if it arises out of present- \
moment awareness. It is also more likely to be effective. It \
will not be a reaction coming from the past conditioning of \
your mind but an intuitive response to the situation. In other \
instances, when the time-bound mind would have reacted, \
you will find it more effective to do nothing \'97 just stay cen- \
tered in the Now. \
\
A QUANTUM LEAP IN THE EVOLUTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS \
\
I have had glimpses of this state of freedom from mind and \
time that you describe, but past and future are so overwhelm- \
ingly strong that I cannot keep them out for long. \
\
\
\
66 \
\
\
\
MOVING DEEPLY INTO THE NOW \
\
The time-bound mode of consciousness is deeply embedded in \
the human psyche. But what we are doing here is part of a \
profound transformation that is taking place in the collective \
consciousness of the planet and beyond: the awakening of con- \
sciousness from the dream of matter, form, and separation. The \
ending of time. We are breaking mind patterns that have domi- \
nated human life for eons. Mind patterns that have created \
unimaginable suffering on a vast scale. I am not using the word \
evil. It is more helpful to call it unconsciousness or insanity. \
\
This breaking up of the old mode of consciousness or rather \
unconsciousness: is it something we have to do or will it hap- \
pen anyway? I mean, is this change inevitable? \
\
That's a question of perspective. The doing and the happen- \
ing is in fact a single process; because you are one with the \
totality of consciousness, you cannot separate the two. But \
there is no absolute guarantee that humans will make it. \
The process isn't inevitable or automatic. Your cooperation \
is an essential part of it. However you look at it, it is a quan- \
tum leap in the evolution of consciousness, as well as our \
only chance of survival as a race. \
\
THE JOY OF BEING \
\
To alert you that you have allowed yourself to be taken over \
by psychological time, you can use a simple criterion. Ask \
yourself: Is there joy, ease, and lightness in what I am doing? \
If there isn't, then time is covering up the present moment, \
and life is perceived as a burden or a struggle. \
\
If there is no joy, ease, or lightness in what you are doing, \
it does not necessarily mean that you need to change what \
\
\
\
bi \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
you are doing. It may be sufficient to change the how. \
"How" is always more important than "what." See if you \
can give much more attention to the doing than to the \
result that you want to achieve through it. Give your \
fullest attention to whatever the moment presents. This \
implies that you also completely accept what is, because \
you cannot give your full attention to something and at the \
same time resist it. \
\
As soon as you honor the present moment, all unhappiness \
and struggle dissolve, and life begins to flow with joy and \
ease. When you act out of present-moment awareness, \
whatever you do becomes imbued with a sense of quality, \
care, and love \'97 even the most simple action. \
\
\
\
So do not be concerned with the fruit of your action \'97 just \
give attention to the action itself. The fruit will come of its \
own accord. This is a powerful spiritual practice. In the \
Bhagavad Gita, one of the oldest and most beautiful spiritual \
teachings in existence, nonattachment to the fruit of your \
action is called Karma Yoga. It is described as the path of \
"consecrated action." \
\
When the compulsive striving away from the Now ceases, \
the joy of Being flows into everything you do. The moment \
your attention turns to the Now, you feel a presence, a still- \
ness, a peace. You no longer depend on the future for fulfill- \
ment and satisfaction \'97 you don't look to it for salvation. \
\
\
\
68 \
\
\
\
MOVING DEEPLY INTOTHE NOW \
\
Therefore, you are not attached to the results. Neither fail- \
ure nor success has the power to change your inner state \
of Being. You have found the life underneath your life sit- \
uation. \
\
In the absence of psychological time, your sense of self is \
derived from Being, not from your personal past. Therefore, \
the psychological need to become anything other than who \
you are already is no longer there. In the world, on the level \
of your life situation, you may indeed become wealthy, knowl- \
edgeable, successful, free of this or that, but in the deeper \
dimension of Being you are complete and whole now. \
\
In that state of wholeness, would we still be able or willing to \
pursue external goals? \
\
Of course, but you will not have illusory expectations that \
anything or anybody in the future will save you or make you \
happy. As far as your life situation is concerned, there may \
be things to be attained or acquired. That's the world of \
form, of gain and loss. Yet on a deeper level you are already \
complete, and when you realize that, there is a playful, joy- \
ous energy behind what you do. Being free of psychological \
time, you no longer pursue your goals with grim determina- \
tion, driven by fear, anger, discontent, or the need to become \
someone. Nor will you remain inactive through fear of fail- \
ure, which to the ego is loss of self. When your deeper sense \
of self is derived from Being, when you are free of "becom- \
ing" as a psychological need, neither your happiness nor \
your sense of self depends on the outcome, and so there is \
freedom from fear. You don't seek permanency where it can- \
not be found: in the world of form, of gain and loss, birth \
\
\
\
69 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
and death. You don't demand that situations, conditions, \
places, or people should make you happy, and then suffer \
when they don't live up to your expectations. \
\
Everything is honored, but nothing matters. Forms are born \
and die, yet you are aware of the eternal underneath the \
forms. You know that "nothing real can be threatened."3 \
\
When this is your state of Being, how can you not succeed? \
You have succeeded already. \

\
MIND STRATEGIES FOR \
AVOIDING THE NOW \
\
\
\
LOSS OF NOW: THE CORE DELUSION \
\
Even if I completely accept that ultimately time is an illusion, \
what difference is that going to make in my life? I still have to \
live in a world that is completely dominated by time. \
\
Intellectual agreement is just another belief and won't make \
much difference to your life. To realize this truth, you need \
to live it. When every cell of your body is so present that it \
feels vibrant with life, and when you can feel that life every \
moment as the joy of Being, then it can be said that you are \
free of time. \
\
But I still have to pay the bills tomorrow, and I am still going \
to grow old and die just like everybody else. So how can I ever \
say that I am free of time? \
\
Tomorrow's bills are not the problem. The dissolution of the \
physical body is not a problem. Loss of Now is the problem, \
or rather: the core delusion that turns a mere situation, \
event, or emotion into a personal problem and into suffer- \
ing. Loss of Now is loss of Being. \
\
\
\
71 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
To be free of time is to be free of the psychological need of \
past for your identity and future for your fulfillment. It rep- \
resents the most profound transformation of consciousness \
that you can imagine. In some rare cases, this shift in con- \
sciousness happens dramatically and radically, once and for \
all. When it does, it usually comes about through total sur- \
render in the midst of intense suffering. Most people, how- \
ever, have to work at it. \
\
When you have had your first few glimpses of the timeless state \
of consciousness, you begin to move back and forth between \
the dimensions of time and presence. First you become aware \
of just how rarely your attention is truly in the Now. But to know \
that you are not present is a great success: That knowing is pres- \
ence \'97 even if initially it only lasts for a couple of seconds of \
clock time before it is lost again. Then, with increasing fre- \
quency, you choose to have the focus of your consciousness in \
the present moment rather than in the past or future, and \
whenever you realize that you had lost the Now, you are able to \
stay in it not just for a couple of seconds, but for longer periods \
as perceived from the external perspective of clock time. So \
before you are firmly established in the state of presence, which \
is to say before you are fully conscious, you shift back and forth \
for a while between consciousness and unconsciousness, be- \
tween the state of presence and the state of mind identifica- \
tion. You lose the Now, and you return to it, again and again. \
Eventually, presence becomes your predominant state. \
\
For most people, presence is experienced either never at \
all or only accidentally and briefly on rare occasions with- \
out being recognized for what it is. Most humans alternate \
not between consciousness and unconsciousness but only \
between different levels of unconsciousness. \
\
\
\
72 \
\
\
\
MIND STRATEGIES FOR AVOIDING THE NOW \
\
ORDINARY UNCONSCIOUSNESS \
AND DEEP UNCONSCIOUSNESS \
\
What do you mean by different levels of unconsciousness? \
\
As you probably know, in sleep you constantly move between \
the phases of dreamless sleep and the dream state. Similarly, \
in wakefulness most people only shift between ordinary \
unconsciousness and deep unconsciousness. What I call \
ordinary unconsciousness means being identified with your \
thought processes and emotions, your reactions, desires, and \
aversions. It is most people's normal state. In that state, you \
are run by the egoic mind, and you are unaware of Being. It \
is a state not of acute pain or unhappiness but of an almost \
continuous low level of unease, discontent, boredom, or \
nervousness \'97 a kind of background static. You may not \
realize this because it is so much a part of "normal" living, \
just as you are not aware of a continuous low background \
noise, such as the hum of an air conditioner, until it stops. \
When it suddenly does stop, there is a sense of relief. Many \
people use alcohol, drugs, sex, food, work, television, or even \
shopping as anesthetics in an unconscious attempt to \
remove the basic unease. When this happens, an activity that \
might be very enjoyable if used in moderation becomes \
imbued with a compulsive or addictive quality, and all that is \
ever achieved through it is extremely short-lived symptom \
relief. \
\
The unease of ordinary unconsciousness turns into the pain \
of deep unconsciousness \'97 a state of more acute and more \
obvious suffering or unhappiness \'97 when things "go \
wrong," when the ego is threatened or there is a major chal- \
lenge, threat, or loss, real or imagined, in your life situation \
\
\
\
73 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
or conflict in a relationship. It is an intensified version of \
ordinary unconsciousness, different from it not in kind but \
in degree. \
\
In ordinary unconsciousness, habitual resistance to or denial \
of what is creates the unease and discontent that most people \
accept as normal living. When this resistance becomes in- \
tensified through some challenge or threat to the ego, it brings \
up intense negativity such as anger, acute fear, aggression, \
depression, and so on. Deep unconsciousness often means \
that the pain-body has been triggered and that you have \
become identified with it. Physical violence would be impos- \
sible without deep unconsciousness. It can also occur easily \
whenever and wherever a crowd of people or even an entire \
nation generates a negative collective energy field. \
\
The best indicator of your level of consciousness is how you \
deal with life's challenges when they come. Through those \
challenges, an already unconscious person tends to become \
more deeply unconscious, and a conscious person more in- \
tensely conscious. You can use a challenge to awaken you, or \
you can allow it to pull you into even deeper sleep. The dream \
of ordinary unconsciousness then turns into a nightmare. \
\
If you cannot be present even in normal circumstances, such \
as when you are sitting alone in a room, walking in the \
woods, or listening to someone, then you certainly won't be \
able to stay conscious when something "goes wrong" or you \
are faced with difficult people or situations, with loss or the \
threat of loss. You will be taken over by a reaction, which \
ultimately is always some form of fear, and pulled into deep \
unconsciousness. Those challenges are your tests. Only \
the way in which you deal with them will show you and \
others where you are at as far as your state of consciousness \
\
\
\
74 \
\
\
\
MIND STRATEGIES FOR AVOIDING THE NOW \
\
is concerned, not how long you can sit with your eyes closed \
or what visions you see. \
\
So it is essential to bring more consciousness into your life \
in ordinary situations when everything is going relatively \
smoothly. In this way, you grow in presence power. It gener- \
ates an energy field in you and around you of a high vibrational \
frequency. No unconsciousness, no negativity, no discord or \
violence can enter that field and survive, just as darkness can- \
not survive in the presence of light. \
\
When you learn to be the witness of your thoughts and emo- \
tions, which is an essential part of being present, you may be \
surprised when you first become aware of the background \
"static" of ordinary unconsciousness and realize how rarely, \
if ever, you are truly at ease within yourself. On the level of \
your thinking, you will find a great deal of resistance in the \
form of judgment, discontent, and mental projection away \
from the Now. On the emotional level, there will be an \
undercurrent of unease, tension, boredom, or nervousness. \
Both are aspects of the mind in its habitual resistance mode. \
\
WHAT ARE THEY SEEKING? \
\
Carl Jung tells in one of his books of a conversation he had \
with a Native American chief who pointed out to him that in \
his perception most white people have tense faces, staring \
eyes, and a cruel demeanor. He said: "They are always seek- \
ing something. What are they seeking? The whites always \
want something. They are always uneasy and restless. We \
don't know what they want. We think they are mad." \
\
The undercurrent of constant unease started long before the \
rise of Western industrial civilization, of course, but in Western \
\
\
\
75 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
civilization, which now covers almost the entire globe, in- \
cluding most of the East, it manifests in an unprecedentedly \
acute form. It was already there at the time of Jesus, and \
it was there six hundred years before that at the time of \
Buddha, and long before that. Why are you always anxious? \
Jesus asked his disciples. "Can anxious thought add a single \
day to your life?" And the Buddha taught that the root of suf- \
fering is to be found in our constant wanting and craving. \
\
Resistance to the Now as a collective dysfunction is intrinsic- \
ally connected to loss of awareness of Being and forms the \
basis of our dehumanized industrial civilization. Freud, by \
the way, also recognized the existence of this undercurrent \
of unease and wrote about it in his book Civilization and Its \
Discontents, but he did not recognize the true root of the \
unease and failed to realize that freedom from it is possible. \
This collective dysfunction has created a very unhappy and \
extraordinarily violent civilization that has become a threat \
not only to itself but also to all life on the planet. \
\
DISSOLVING ORDINARY UNCONSCIOUSNESS \
\
So how can we be free of this affliction? \
\
Make it conscious. Observe the many ways in which unease, \
discontent, and tension arise within you through unneces- \
sary judgment, resistance to what is, and denial of the Now. \
Anything unconscious dissolves when you shine the light of \
consciousness on it. Once you know how to dissolve ordi- \
nary unconsciousness, the light of your presence will shine \
brightly, and it will be much easier to deal with deep uncon- \
sciousness whenever you feel its gravitational pull. However, \
\
\
\

\
\
\
MIND STRATEGIES FOR AVOIDING THE NOW \
\
ordinary unconsciousness may not be easy to detect initially \
because it is so normal. \
\
Make it a habit to monitor your mental-emotional state \
through self-observation. "Am I at ease at this moment?" is \
a good question to ask yourself frequently. Or you can ask: \
"What's going on inside me at this moment?" Be at least as \
interested in what goes on inside you as what happens out- \
side. If you get the inside right, the outside will fall into \
place. Primary reality is within, secondary reality without. \
But don't answer these questions immediately. Direct your \
attention inward. Have a look inside yourself. What kind of \
thoughts is your mind producing? What do you feel? Direct \
your attention into the body. Is there any tension? Once you \
detect that there is a low level of unease, the background \
static, see in what way you are avoiding, resisting, or deny- \
ing life \'97 by denying the Now. There are many ways in \
which people unconsciously resist the present moment. I \
will give you a few examples. With practice, your power of \
self-observation, of monitoring your inner state, will \
become sharpened. \
\
FREEDOM FROM UNHAPPINESS \
\
Do you resent doing what you are doing? It may be your job, \
or you may have agreed to do something and are doing it, but \
part of you resents and resists it. Are you carrying unspoken \
resentment toward a person close to you? Do you realize that \
the energy you thus emanate is so harmful in its effects \
that you are in fact contaminating yourself as well as those \
around you? Have a good look inside. Is there even the \
slightest trace of resentment, unwillingness? If there is, \
\
\
\
77 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
observe it on both the mental and the emotional levels. What \
thoughts is your mind creating around this situation? Then \
look at the emotion, which is the body's reaction to those \
thoughts. Feel the emotion. Does it feel pleasant or unpleas- \
ant? Is it an energy that you would actually choose to have \
inside you? Do you have a choice? \
\
Maybe you are being taken advantage of, maybe the activity \
you are engaged in is tedious, maybe someone close to you \
is dishonest, irritating, or unconscious, but all this is irrel- \
evant. Whether your thoughts and emotions about this \
situation are justified or not makes no difference. The fact is \
that you are resisting what is. You are making the present \
moment into an enemy. You are creating unhappiness, con- \
flict between the inner and the outer. Your unhappiness is \
polluting not only your own inner being and those around \
you but also the collective human psyche of which you are an \
inseparable part. The pollution of the planet is only an out- \
ward reflection of an inner psychic pollution: millions of \
unconscious individuals not taking responsibility for their \
inner space. \
\
Either stop doing what you are doing, speak to the person \
concerned and express fully what you feel, or drop the nega- \
tivity that your mind has created around the situation and \
that serves no purpose whatsoever except to strengthen a \
false sense of self. Recognizing its futility is important. \
Negativity is never the optimum way of dealing with any sit- \
uation. In fact, in most cases it keeps you stuck in it, block- \
ing real change. Anything that is done with negative energy \
will become contaminated by it and in time give rise to more \
pain, more unhappiness. Furthermore, any negative inner \
\
\
\
78 \
\
\
\
MIND STRATEGIES FOR AVOIDING THE NOW \
\
state is contagious: Unhappiness spreads more easily than a \
physical disease. Through the law of resonance, it triggers \
and feeds latent negativity in others, unless they are immune \
\'97 that is, highly conscious. \
\
Are you polluting the world or cleaning up the mess? You \
are responsible for your inner space; nobody else is, just as \
you are responsible for the planet. As within, so without: If \
humans clear inner pollution, then they will also cease to \
create outer pollution. \
\
How can we drop negativity, as you suggest? \
\
By dropping it. How do you drop a piece of hot coal that you \
are holding in your hand? How do you drop some heavy and \
useless baggage that you are carrying? By recognizing that \
you don't want to suffer the pain or carry the burden any- \
more and then letting go of it. \
\
Deep unconsciousness, such as the pain-body, or other deep \
pain, such as the loss of a loved one, usually needs to be trans- \
muted through acceptance combined with the light of your \
presence \'97 your sustained attention. Many patterns in ordi- \
nary unconsciousness, on the other hand, can simply be \
dropped once you know that you don't want them and don't \
need them anymore, once you realize that you have a choice, \
that you are not just a bundle of conditioned reflexes. All this \
implies that you are able to access the power of Now. Without \
it, you have no choice. \
\
If you call some emotions negative, aren't you creating a men- \
tal polarity of good and bad, as you explained earlier? \
\
\
\
79 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
No. The polarity was created at an earlier stage when your \
mind judged the present moment as bad; this judgment \
then created the negative emotion. \
\
But if you call some emotions negative, aren't you really say- \
ing that they shouldn't be there, that it's not okay to have those \
emotions? My understanding is that we should give ourselves \
permission to have whatever feelings come up, rather than \
judge them as had or say that we shouldn't have them. It's \
okay to feel resentful; it's okay to he angry, irritated, moody, or \
whatever \'97 otherwise, we get into repression, inner conflict, \
or denial. Everything is okay as it is. \
\
Of course. Once a mind pattern, an emotion, or a reaction is \
there, accept it. You were not conscious enough to have a \
choice in the matter. That's not a judgment, just a fact. If you \
had a choice, or realized that you do have a choice, would \
you choose suffering or joy, ease or unease, peace or \
conflict? Would you choose a thought or feeling that cuts you \
off from your natural state of well-being, the joy of life \
within? Any such feeling I call negative, which simply means \
bad. Not in the sense that "You shouldn't have done that," \
but just plain factual bad, like feeling sick in the stomach. \
\
How is it possible that humans killed in excess of one hun- \
dred million fellow humans in the twentieth century alone?4 \
Humans inflicting pain of such magnitude on one another is \
beyond anything you can imagine. And that's not taking into \
account the mental, emotional and physical violence, the tor- \
ture, pain, and cruelty they continue to inflict on each other \
as well as on other sentient beings on a daily basis. \
\
Do they act in this way because they are in touch with their nat- \
ural state, the joy of life within? Of course not. Only people \
\
\
\
80 \
\
\
\
MIND STRATEGIES FOR AVOIDING THE NOW \
\
who are in a deeply negative state, who feel very bad indeed, \
would create such a reality as a reflection of how they feel. \
Now they are engaged in destroying nature and the planet \
that sustains them. Unbelievable but true. Humans are a \
dangerously insane and very sick species. That's not a judg- \
ment. It's a fact. It is also a fact that the sanity is there under- \
neath the madness. Healing and redemption are available \
right now. \
\
Coming back specifically to what you said \'97 it is certainly \
true that when you accept your resentment, moodiness, \
anger, and so on, you are no longer forced to act them out \
blindly, and you are less likely to project them onto others. \
But I wonder if you are not deceiving yourself. When you \
have been practicing acceptance for a while, as you have, \
there comes a point when you need to go on to the next \
stage, where those negative emotions are not created any- \
more. If you don't, your "acceptance" just becomes a mental \
label that allows your ego to continue to indulge in unhappi- \
ness and so strengthen its sense of separation from other \
people, your surroundings, your here and now. As you know, \
separation is the basis for the ego's sense of identity. True \
acceptance would transmute those feelings at once. And if \
you really knew deeply that everything is "okay," as you put \
it, and which of course is true, then would you have those \
negative feelings in the first place? Without judgment, with- \
out resistance to what is, they would not arise. You have an \
idea in your mind that "everything is okay," but deep down \
you don't really believe it, and so the old mental-emotional \
patterns of resistance are still in place. That's what makes you \
feel bad. \
\
That's okay, too. \
\
\
\
81 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
Are you defending your right to be unconscious, your right \
to suffer? Don't worry: Nobody is going to take that away \
from you. Once you realize that a certain kind of food makes \
you sick, would you carry on eating that food and keep assert- \
ing that it is okay to be sick? \
\
WHEREVER YOU ARE, BE THERE TOTALLY \
\
Can you give some more examples of ordinary unconsciousness? \
\
See if you can catch yourself complaining, in either speech \
or thought, about a situation you find yourself in, what other \
people do or say, your surroundings, your life situation, even \
the weather. To complain is always nonacceptance of what is. \
It invariably carries an unconscious negative charge. When \
you complain, you make yourself into a victim. When you \
speak out, you are in your power. So change the situation by \
taking action or by speaking out if necessary or possible; \
leave the situation or accept it. All else is madness. \
\
Ordinary unconsciousness is always linked in some way \
with denial of the Now. The Now, of course, also implies the \
here. Are you resisting your here and now? Some people \
would always rather be somewhere else. Their "here" is \
never good enough. Through self-observation, find out if \
that is the case in your life. Wherever you are, be there \
totally. If you find your here and now intolerable and it \
makes you unhappy, you have three options: remove your- \
self from the situation, change it, or accept it totally. If you \
want to take responsibility for your life, you must choose one \
of those three options, and you must choose now. Then \
accept the consequences. No excuses. No negativity. No psy- \
chic pollution. Keep your inner space clear. \
\
\
\
82 \
\
\
\
MIND STRATEGIES FOR AVOIDING THE NOW \
\
If you take any action \'97 leaving or changing your situation \
\'97 drop the negativity first, if at all possible. Action arising \
out of insight into what is required is more effective than \
action arising out of negativity. \
\
Any action is often better than no action, especially if you \
have been stuck in an unhappy situation for a long time. If it \
is a mistake, at least you learn something, in which case it's \
no longer a mistake. If you remain stuck, you learn nothing. \
Is fear preventing you from taking action? Acknowledge the \
fear, watch it, take your attention into it, be fully present with \
it. Doing so cuts the link between the fear and your thinking. \
Don't let the fear rise up into your mind. Use the power of the \
Now. Fear cannot prevail against it. \
\
If there is truly nothing that you can do to change your here \
and now, and you can't remove yourself from the situation, \
then accept your here and now totally by dropping all inner \
resistance. The false, unhappy self that loves feeling miser- \
able, resentful, or sorry for itself can then no longer survive. \
This is called surrender. Surrender is not weakness. There is \
great strength in it. Only a surrendered person has spiritual \
power. Through surrender, you will be free internally of the \
situation. You may then find that the situation changes with- \
out any effort on your part. In any case, you are free. \
\
Or is there something that you "should" be doing but are not \
doing it? Get up and do it now. Alternatively, completely \
accept your inactivity, laziness, or passivity at this moment, \
if that is your choice. Go into it fully. Enjoy it. Be as lazy or \
inactive as you can. If you go into it fully and consciously, \
you will soon come out of it. Or maybe you won't. Either way, \
there is no inner conflict, no resistance, no negativity. \
\
\
\
83 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
Are you stressed? Are you so busy getting to the future that the \
present is reduced to a means of getting there? Stress is caused \
by being "here" but wanting to be "there," or being in the pres- \
ent but wanting to be in the future. It's a split that tears you \
apart inside. To create and live with such an inner split is \
insane. The fact that everyone else is doing it doesn't make it \
any less insane. If you have to, you can move fast, work fast, \
or even run, without projecting yourself into the future and \
without resisting the present. As you move, work, run \'97 do \
it totally. Enjoy the flow of energy, the high energy of that \
moment. Now you are no longer stressed, no longer splitting \
yourself in two. Just moving, running, working \'97 and enjoy- \
ing it. Or you can drop the whole thing and sit on a park bench. \
But when you do, watch your mind. It may say: "You should be \
working. You are wasting time." Observe the mind. Smile at it. \
\
Does the past take up a great deal of your attention? Do you \
frequently talk and think about it, either positively or nega- \
tively? The great things that you have achieved, your adven- \
tures or experiences, or your victim story and the dreadful \
things that were done to you, or maybe what you did to \
someone else? Are your thought processes creating guilt, \
pride, resentment, anger, regret, or self-pity? Then you are \
not only reinforcing a false sense of self but also helping to \
accelerate your body's aging process by creating an accumu- \
lation of past in your psyche. Verify this for yourself by \
observing those around you who have a strong tendency to \
hold on to the past. \
\
Die to the past every moment. You don't need it. Only refer \
to it when it is absolutely relevant to the present. Feel the \
power of this moment and the fullness of Being. Feel your \
presence. \
\
\
\
84 \
\
\
\
MIND STRATEGIES FOR AVOIDING THE NOW \
\
\
\
Are you worried? Do you have many "what if thoughts? You \
are identified with your mind, which is projecting itself into \
an imaginary future situation and creating fear. There is \
no way that you can cope with such a situation, because it \
doesn't exist. It's a mental phantom. You can stop this \
health- and life-corroding insanity simply by acknowledging \
the present moment. Become aware of your breathing. Feel \
the air flowing in and out of your body. Feel your inner \
energy field. All that you ever have to deal with, cope with, in \
real life \'97 as opposed to imaginary mind projections \'97 is \
this moment. Ask yourself what "problem" you have right \
now, not next year, tomorrow, or five minutes from now. \
What is wrong with this moment? You can always cope with \
the Now, but you can never cope with the future \'97 nor do \
you have to. The answer, the strength, the right action or the \
resource will be there when you need it, not before, not after. \
\
"One day I'll make it." Is your goal taking up so much of \
your attention that you reduce the present moment to a \
means to an end? Is it taking the joy out of your doing? Are \
you waiting to start living? If you develop such a mind pat- \
tern, no matter what you achieve or get, the present will \
never be good enough; the future will always seem better. A \
perfect recipe for permanent dissatisfaction and nonfulfill- \
ment, don't you agree? \
\
Are you a habitual "waiter"? How much of your life do you \
spend waiting? What I call "small-scale waiting" is waiting in \
\
\
\
85 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
line at the post office, in a traffic jam, at the airport, or wait- \
ing for someone to arrive, to finish work, and so on. "Large- \
scale waiting" is waiting for the next vacation, for a better \
job, for the children to grow up, for a truly meaningful rela- \
tionship, for success, to make money, to be important, to \
become enlightened. It is not uncommon for people to \
spend their whole life waiting to start living. \
\
Waiting is a state of mind. Basically, it means that you want \
the future; you don't want the present. You don't want what \
you've got, and you want what you haven't got. With every kind \
of waiting, you unconsciously create inner conflict between \
your here and now, where you don't want to be, and the pro- \
jected future, where you want to be. This greatly reduces the \
quality of your life by making you lose the present. \
\
There is nothing wrong with striving to improve your life sit- \
uation. You can improve your life situation, but you cannot \
improve your life. Life is primary. Life is your deepest inner \
Being. It is already whole, complete, perfect. Your life situa- \
tion consists of your circumstances and your experiences. \
There is nothing wrong with setting goals and striving to \
achieve things. The mistake lies in using it as a substitute for \
the feeling of life, for Being. The only point of access for that \
is the Now. You are then like an architect who pays no atten- \
tion to the foundation of a building but spends a lot of time \
working on the superstructure. \
\
For example, many people are waiting for prosperity. It \
cannot come in the future. When you honor, acknowledge, \
and fully accept your present reality \'97 where you are, who \
you are, what you are doing right now \'97 when you fully \
accept what you have got, you are grateful for what you have \
got, grateful for what is, grateful for Being. Gratitude for the \
\
\
\
86 \
\
\
\
MIND STRATEGIES FOR AVOIDING THE NOW \
\
present moment and the fullness of life now is true prosper- \
ity. It cannot come in the future. Then, in time, that pros- \
perity manifests for you in various ways. \
\
If you are dissatisfied with what you have got, or even frus- \
trated or angry about your present lack, that may motivate \
you to become rich, but even if you do make millions, you \
will continue to experience the inner condition of lack, and \
deep down you will continue to feel unfulfilled. You may \
have many exciting experiences that money can buy, but they \
will come and go and always leave you with an empty feel- \
ing and the need for further physical or psychological grati- \
fication. You won't abide in Being and so feel the fullness of \
life now that alone is true prosperity. \
\
So give up waiting as a state of mind. When you catch your- \
self slipping into waiting . . . snap out of it. Come into the \
present moment. Just be, and enjoy being. If you are present, \
there is never any need for you to wait for anything. So next \
time somebody says, "Sorry to have kept you waiting," you \
can reply, "That's all right, I wasn't waiting. I was just stand- \
ing here enjoying myself \'97 in joy in my self." \
\
These are just a few of the habitual mind strategies for deny- \
ing the present moment that are part of ordinary uncon- \
sciousness. They are easy to overlook because they are so \
much a part of normal living: the background static of per- \
petual discontent. But the more you practice monitoring \
your inner mental-emotional state, the easier it will be to \
know when you have been trapped in past or future, which \
is to say unconscious, and to awaken out of the dream of \
time into the present. But beware: The false, unhappy self, \
based on mind identification, lives on time. It knows that the \
present moment is its own death and so feels very threatened \
\
\
\

\
by it. It will do all it can to take you out of it. It will try to keep \
you trapped in time. \
\
THE INNER PURPOSE OF YOUR LIFE'S JOURNEY \
\
I can see the truth of what you are saying, but I still think that \
we must have purpose on our life's journey; otherwise we just \
drift, and purpose means future, doesn't it? How do we recon- \
cile that with living in the present? \
\
When you are on a journey, it is certainly helpful to know \
where you are going or at least the general direction in \
which you are moving, but don't forget: The only thing that \
is ultimately real about your journey is the step that you are \
taking at this moment. That's all there ever is. \
\
Your life's journey has an outer purpose and an inner pur- \
pose. The outer purpose is to arrive at your goal or destina- \
tion, to accomplish what you set out to do, to achieve this or \
that, which, of course, implies future. But if your destina- \
tion, or the steps you are going to take in the future, take up \
so much of your attention that they become more important \
to you than the step you are taking now, then you completely \
miss the journey's inner purpose, which has nothing to do \
with where you are going or what you are doing, but every- \
thing to do with how. It has nothing to do with future but \
everything to do with the quality of your consciousness at \
this moment. The outer purpose belongs to the horizontal \
dimension of space and time; the inner purpose concerns \
a deepening of your Being in the vertical dimension of \
the timeless Now. Your outer journey may contain a million \
steps; your inner journey only has one: the step you are \
\
\
\
88 \
\
\
\
MIND STRATEGIES FOR AVOIDING THE NOW \
\
taking right now. As you become more deeply aware of this \
one step, you realize that it already contains within itself all \
the other steps as well as the destination. This one step then \
becomes transformed into an expression of perfection, an \
act of great beauty and quality. It will have taken you into \
Being, and the light of Being will shine through it. This is \
both the purpose and the fulfillment of your inner journey, \
the journey into yourself. \
\
\
\
Does it matter whether we achieve our outer purpose, whether \
we succeed or fail in the world? \
\
It will matter to you as long as you haven't realized your \
inner purpose. After that, the outer purpose is just a game \
that you may continue to play simply because you enjoy it. It \
is also possible to fail completely in your outer purpose and \
at the same time totally succeed in your inner purpose. Or \
the other way around, which is actually more common: outer \
riches and inner poverty, or to "gain the world and lose your \
soul," as Jesus puts it. Ultimately, of course, every outer pur- \
pose is doomed to "fail" sooner or later, simply because it is \
subject to the law of impermanence of all things. The sooner \
you realize that your outer purpose cannot give you lasting \
fulfillment, the better. When you have seen the limitations of \
your outer purpose, you give up your unrealistic expectation \
that it should make you happy, and you make it subservient \
to your inner purpose. \
\
\
\
89 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
THE PAST CANNOT SURVIVE IN YOUR PRESENCE \
\
You mentioned that thinking or talking about the past unnec- \
essarily is one of the ways in which we avoid the present. But \
apart from the past that we remember and perhaps identify \
with, isn't there another level of past within us that is much \
more deep-seated? I am talking about the unconscious past \
that conditions our lives, especially through early childhood \
experiences, perhaps even past-life experiences. And then there \
is our cultural conditioning, which has to do with where we \
live geographically and the historical time period in which \
we live. All these things determine how we see the world, how we \
react, what we think, what kind of relationships we have, how \
we live our lives. How could we ever become conscious of all \
that or get rid of it? How long would that take? And even if \
we did, what would there be left? \
\
What is left when illusion ends? \
\
There is no need to investigate the unconscious past in you \
except as it manifests at this moment as a thought, an emo- \
tion, a desire, a reaction, or an external event that happens to \
you. Whatever you need to know about the unconscious past \
in you, the challenges of the present will bring it out. If you \
delve into the past, it will become a bottomless pit: There is \
always more. You may think that you need more time to \
understand the past or become free of it, in other words, that \
the future will eventually free you of the past. This is a delu- \
sion. Only the present can free you of the past. More time can- \
not free you of time. Access the power of Now. That is the key. \
\
What is the power of Now? \
\
\
\
90 \
\
\
\
MIND STRATEGIES FOR AVOIDING THE NOW \
\
None other than the power of your presence, your conscious- \
ness liberated from thought forms. \
\
So deal with the past on the level of the present. The more \
attention you give to the past, the more you energize it, and the \
more likely you are to make a "self out of it. Don't misunder- \
stand: Attention is essential, but not to the past as past. Give \
attention to the present; give attention to your behavior, to \
your reactions, moods, thoughts, emotions, fears, and desires \
as they occur in the present. There's the past in you. If you can \
be present enough to watch all those things, not critically or \
analytically but nonjudgmentally, then you are dealing with \
the past and dissolving it through the power of your presence. \
You cannot find yourself by going into the past. You find your- \
self by coming into the present. \
\
Isn't it helpful to understand the past and so understand why \
we do certain things, react in certain ways, or why we uncon- \
sciously create our particular kind of drama, patterns in rela- \
tionships, and so on? \
\
As you become more conscious of your present reality, you \
may suddenly get certain insights as to why your conditioning \
functions in those particular ways \'97 for example, why your \
relationships follow certain patterns \'97 and you may remem- \
ber things that happened in the past or see them more clearly. \
That is fine and can be helpful, but it is not essential. What is \
essential is your conscious presence. That dissolves the past. \
That is the transformative agent. So don't seek to understand \
the past, but be as present as you can. The past cannot survive \
in your presence. It can only survive in your absence. \
\

\
CHAPTER FIVE \
\
\
\
THE STATE OF PRESENCE \
\
\
\
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK IT IS \
\
You keep talking about the state of presence as the key. I think I \
understand it intellectually, but I don't know if I have ever truly \
experienced it. I wonder \'97 is it what I think it is, or is it some- \
thing entirely different? \
\
It's not what you think it is! You can't think about presence, \
and the mind can't understand it. Understanding presence \
is being present. \
\
Try a little experiment. Close your eyes and say to yourself: \
"I wonder what my next thought is going to be." Then \
become very alert and wait for the next thought. Be like a cat \
watching a mouse hole. What thought is going to come out \
of the mouse hole? Try it now. \
\
\
\
Well? \
\
\
\
93 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
I had to wait for quite a long time before a thought came in. \
\
Exactly. As long as you are in a state of intense presence, you \
are free of thought. You are still, yet highly alert. The instant \
your conscious attention sinks below a certain level, thought \
rushes in. The mental noise returns; the stillness is lost. You \
are back in time. \
\
To test their degree of presence, some Zen masters have \
been known to creep up on their students from behind and \
suddenly hit them with a stick. Quite a shock! If the student \
had been fully present and in a state of alertness, if he had \
"kept his loin girded and his lamp burning," which is one of \
the analogies that Jesus uses for presence, he would have \
noticed the master coming up from behind and stopped him \
or stepped aside. But if he were hit, that would mean he was \
immersed in thought, which is to say absent, unconscious. \
\
To stay present in everyday life, it helps to be deeply rooted \
within yourself; otherwise, the mind, which has incredible \
momentum, will drag you along like a wild river. \
\
What do you mean by "rooted within yourself"? \
\
It means to inhabit your body fully. To always have some of \
your attention in the inner energy field of your body. To feel \
the body from within, so to speak. Body awareness keeps you \
present. It anchors you in the Now (see chapter 6). \
\
THE ESOTERIC MEANING OF "WAITING" \
\
In a sense, the state of presence could be compared to wait- \
ing. Jesus used the analogy of waiting in some of his parables. \
\
\
\
94 \
\
\
\
THE STAT E OF PRESENCE \
\
This is not the usual bored or restless kind of waiting that \
is a denial of the present and that I spoke about already. It is \
not a waiting in which your attention is focused on some \
point in the future and the present is perceived as an undesir- \
able obstacle that prevents you from having what you want. \
There is a qualitatively different kind of waiting, one that re- \
quires your total alertness. Something could happen at any \
moment, and if you are not absolutely awake, absolutely still, \
you will miss it. This is the kind of waiting Jesus talks about. \
In that state, all your attention is in the Now. There is none \
left for daydreaming, thinking, remembering, anticipating. \
There is no tension in it, no fear, just alert presence. You are \
present with your whole Being, with every cell of your body. \
In that state, the "you" that has a past and a future \'97 the per- \
sonality, if you like \'97 is hardly there anymore. And yet noth- \
ing of value is lost. You are still essentially yourself. In fact, \
you are more fully yourself than you ever were before, or \
rather it is only now that you are truly yourself. \
\
"Be like a servant waiting for the return of the master," says \
Jesus. The servant does not know at what hour the master is \
going to come. So he stays awake, alert, poised, still, lest he \
miss the master's arrival. In another parable, Jesus speaks \
of the five careless (unconscious) women who do not have \
enough oil (consciousness) to keep their lamps burning \
(stay present) and so miss the bridegroom (the Now) and \
don't get to the wedding feast (enlightenment). These five \
stand in contrast to the five wise women who have enough \
oil (stay conscious). \
\
Even the men who wrote the Gospels did not understand \
the meaning of these parables, so the first misinterpreta- \
tions and distortions crept in as they were written down. \
\
\
\
95 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
With subsequent erroneous interpretations, the real mean- \
ing was completely lost. These are parables not about the end \
of the world but about the end of psychological time. They \
point to the transcendence of the egoic mind and the possi- \
bility of living in an entirely new state of consciousness. \
\
BEAUTY ARISES IN THE STILLNESS OF YOUR PRESENCE \
\
What you have just described is something that I occasionally \
experience for brief moments when I am alone and surrounded \
by nature. \
\
Yes. Zen masters use the word satori to describe a flash of \
insight, a moment of no-mind and total presence. Although \
satori is not a lasting transformation, be grateful when it \
comes, for it gives you a taste of enlightenment. You may, \
indeed, have experienced it many times without knowing what \
it is and realizing its importance. Presence is needed to \
become aware of the beauty, the majesty, the sacredness of \
nature. Have you ever gazed up into the infinity of space on a \
clear night, awestruck by the absolute stillness and inconceiv- \
able vastness of it? Have you listened, truly listened, to the \
sound of a mountain stream in the forest? Or to the song of a \
blackbird at dusk on a quiet summer evening? To become \
aware of such things, the mind needs to be still. You have to \
put down for a moment your personal baggage of problems, of \
past and future, as well as all your knowledge; otherwise, you \
will see but not see, hear but not hear. Your total presence is \
required. \
\
Beyond the beauty of the external forms, there is more here: \
something that cannot be named, something ineffable, some \
deep, inner, holy essence. Whenever and wherever there is \
\
\
\
96 \
\
\
\
THE STATE OF PRESENCE \
\
beauty, this inner essence shines through somehow. It only \
reveals itself to you when you are present. Could it be that \
this nameless essence and your presence are one and the \
same? Would it be there without your presence? Go deeply \
into it. Find out for yourself. \
\
\
\
When you experienced those moments of presence, you \
likely didn't realize that you were briefly in a state of no- \
mind. This is because the gap between that state and the \
influx of thought was too narrow. Your satori may only have \
lasted for a few seconds before the mind came in, but it was \
there; otherwise, you would not have experienced the beauty. \
Mind can neither recognize nor create beauty. Only for a few \
seconds, while you were completely present, was that beauty \
or that sacredness there. Because of the narrowness of that \
gap and a lack of vigilance and alertness on your part, you \
were probably unable to see the fundamental difference be- \
tween the perception, the thoughtless awareness of beauty, \
and the naming and interpreting of it as thought: The time \
gap was so small that it seemed to be a single process. The \
truth is, however, that the moment thought came in, all you \
had was a memory of it. \
\
The wider the time gap between perception and thought, the \
more depth there is to you as a human being, which is to say \
the more conscious you are. \
\
Many people are so imprisoned in their minds that the \
beauty of nature does not really exist for them. They might \
\
\
\
97 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
say, "What a pretty flower," but that's just a mechanical men- \
tal labeling. Because they are not still, not present, they don't \
truly see the flower, don't feel its essence, its holiness \'97 just \
as they don't know themselves, don't feel their own essence, \
their own holiness. \
\
Because we live in such a mind-dominated culture, most \
modern art, architecture, music, and literature are devoid of \
beauty, of inner essence, with very few exceptions. The rea- \
son is that the people who create those things cannot \'97 even \
for a moment \'97 free themselves from their mind. So they \
are never in touch with that place within where true creativ- \
ity and beauty arise. The mind left to itself creates monstrosi- \
ties, and not only in art galleries. Look at our urban landscapes \
and industrial wastelands. No civilization has ever produced \
so much ugliness. \
\
REALIZING PURE CONSCIOUSNESS \
\
7s presence the same as Being? \
\
When you become conscious of Being, what is really hap- \
pening is that Being becomes conscious of itself. When \
Being becomes conscious of itself \'97 that's presence. Since \
Being, consciousness, and life are synonymous, we could say \
that presence means consciousness becoming conscious of \
itself, or life attaining self-consciousness. But don't get \
attached to the words, and don't make an effort to under- \
stand this. There is nothing that you need to understand \
before you can become present. \
\
I do understand what you just said, but it seems to imply that \
Being, the ultimate transcendental reality, is not yet complete, \
\
\
\
98 \
\
\
\
THE STATE OF PRESENCE \
\
that it is undergoing a process of development. Does God need \
time for personal growth? \
\
Yes, but only as seen from the limited perspective of the mani- \
fested universe. In the Bible, God declares: "I am the Alpha \
and the Omega, and I am the living One." In the timeless \
realm where God dwells, which is also your home, the begin- \
ning and the end, the Alpha and the Omega, are one, and the \
essence of everything that ever has been and ever will be is \
eternally present in an unmanifested state of oneness and \
perfection \'97 totally beyond anything the human mind can \
ever imagine or comprehend. In our world of seemingly sepa- \
rate forms, however, timeless perfection is an inconceivable \
concept. Here even consciousness, which is the light ema- \
nating from the eternal Source, seems to be subject to a \
process of development, but this is due to our limited per- \
ception. It is not so in absolute terms. Nevertheless, let me \
continue to speak for a moment about the evolution of con- \
sciousness in this world. \
\
Everything that exists has Being, has God-essence, has some \
degree of consciousness. Even a stone has rudimentary con- \
sciousness; otherwise, it would not be, and its atoms and mol- \
ecules would disperse. Everything is alive. The sun, the earth, \
plants, animals, humans \'97 all are expressions of conscious- \
ness in varying degrees, consciousness manifesting as form. \
\
The world arises when consciousness takes on shapes and \
forms, thought forms and material forms. Look at the mil- \
lions of life forms on this planet alone. In the sea, on land, \
in the air \'97 and then each life form is replicated millions of \
times. To what end? Is someone or something playing a \
game, a game with form? This is what the ancient seers of \
\
\
\
99 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
India asked themselves. They saw the world as lila, a kind of \
divine game that God is playing. The individual life forms \
are obviously not very important in this game. In the sea, \
most life forms don't survive for more than a few minutes \
after being born. The human form turns to dust pretty \
quickly too, and when it is gone it is as if it had never been. \
Is that tragic or cruel? Only if you create a separate identity \
for each form, if you forget that its consciousness is God- \
essence expressing itself in form. But you don't truly know \
that until you realize your own God-essence as pure con- \
sciousness. \
\
If a fish is born in your aquarium and you call him John, \
write out a birth certificate, tell him about his family history, \
and two minutes later he gets eaten by another fish \'97 that's \
tragic. But it's only tragic because you projected a separate \
self where there was none. You got hold of a fraction of a \
dynamic process, a molecular dance, and made a separate \
entity out of it. \
\
Consciousness takes on the disguise of forms until they reach \
such complexity that it completely loses itself in them. In \
present-day humans, consciousness is completely identified \
with its disguise. It only knows itself as form and therefore \
lives in fear of the annihilation of its physical or psychologi- \
cal form. This is the egoic mind, and this is where consider- \
able dysfunction sets in. It now looks as if something had \
gone very wrong somewhere along the line of evolution. But \
even this is part of lila, the divine game. Finally, the pressure \
of suffering created by this apparent dysfunction forces con- \
sciousness to disidentify from form and awakens it from its \
dream of form: It regains self-consciousness, but it is at a far \
deeper level than when it lost it. \
\
\
\
100 \
\
\
\
THE STAT E OF PRESENCE \
\
This process is explained by Jesus in his parable of the lost \
son, who leaves his father's home, squanders his wealth, \
becomes destitute, and is then forced by his suffering to \
return home. When he does, his father loves him more than \
before. The son's state is the same as it was before, yet not \
the same. It has an added dimension of depth. The parable \
describes a journey from unconscious perfection, through \
apparent imperfection and "evil" to conscious perfection. \
\
Can you now see the deeper and wider significance of becom- \
ing present as the watcher of your mind? Whenever you \
watch the mind, you withdraw consciousness from mind \
forms, and it then becomes what we call the watcher or the \
witness. Consequently, the watcher \'97 pure consciousness \
beyond form \'97 becomes stronger, and the mental forma- \
tions become weaker. When we talk about watching the mind \
we are personalizing an event that is truly of cosmic signifi- \
cance: Through you, consciousness is awakening out of its \
dream of identification with form and withdrawing from \
form. This foreshadows, but is already part of, an event that is \
probably still in the distant future as far as chronological time \
is concerned. The event is called \'97 the end of the world. \
\
\
\
When consciousness frees itself from its identification with \
physical and mental forms, it becomes what we may call \
pure or enlightened consciousness, or presence. This has \
already happened in a few individuals, and it seems destined \
to happen soon on a much larger scale, although there is no \
absolute guarantee that it will happen. Most humans are still \
\
\
\
101 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
in the grip of the egoic mode of consciousness: identified \
with their mind and run by their mind. If they do not free \
themselves from their mind in time, they will be destroyed \
by it. They will experience increasing confusion, conflict, vio- \
lence, illness, despair, madness. Egoic mind has become like \
a sinking ship. If you don't get off, you will go down with it. \
The collective egoic mind is the most dangerously insane \
and destructive entity ever to inhabit this planet. What do \
you think will happen on this planet if human consciousness \
remains unchanged? \
\
Already for most humans, the only respite they find from \
their own minds is to occasionally revert to a level of con- \
sciousness below thought. Everyone does that every night \
during sleep. But this also happens to some extent through \
sex, alcohol, and other drugs that suppress excessive mind \
activity. If it weren't for alcohol, tranquilizers, antidepressants, \
as well as the illegal drugs, which are all consumed in vast \
quantities, the insanity of the human mind would become \
even more glaringly obvious than it is already. I believe that, \
if deprived of their drugs, a large part of the population \
would become a danger to themselves and others. These \
drugs, of course, simply keep you stuck in dysfunction. Their \
widespread use only delays the breakdown of the old mind \
structures and the emergence of higher consciousness. \
While individual users may get some relief from the daily \
torture inflicted on them by their minds, they are prevented \
from generating enough conscious presence to rise above \
thought and so find true liberation. \
\
Falling back to a level of consciousness below mind, which is \
the pre-thinking level of our distant ancestors and of animals \
and plants, is not an option for us. There is no way back. If \
\
\
\
102 \
\
\
\
THE STATE OF PRESENCE \
\
the human race is to survive, it will have to go on to the next \
stage. Consciousness is evolving throughout the universe in \
billions of forms. So even if we didn't make it, this wouldn't \
matter on a cosmic scale. No gain in consciousness is ever \
lost, so it would simply express itself through some other \
form. But the very fact that I am speaking here and you are \
listening or reading this is a clear sign that the new con- \
sciousness is gaining a foothold on the planet. \
\
There is nothing personal in this: I am not teaching you. \
You are consciousness, and you are listening to yourself. \
There is an Eastern saying: "The teacher and the taught \
together create the teaching." In any case, the words in \
themselves are not important. They are not the Truth; they \
only point to it. I speak from presence, and as I speak, you \
may be able to join me in that state. Although every word \
that I use has a history, of course, and comes from the past, \
as all language does, the words that I speak to you now are \
carriers of the high-energy frequency of presence, quite \
apart from the meaning they convey as words. \
\
Silence is an even more potent carrier of presence, so when \
you read this or listen to me speak, be aware of the silence \
between and underneath the words. Be aware of the gaps. To \
listen to the silence, wherever you are, is an easy and direct \
way of becoming present. Even if there is noise, there is \
always some silence underneath and in between the sounds. \
Listening to the silence immediately creates stillness inside \
you. Only the stillness in you can perceive the silence out- \
side. And what is stillness other than presence, conscious- \
ness freed from thought forms? Here is the living realization \
of what we have been talking about. \
\
\
\
103 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
CHRIST: THE REALITY OF YOUR DIVINE PRESENCE \
\
Don't get attached to any one word. You can substitute \
"Christ" for presence, if that is more meaningful to you. Christ \
is your God-essence or the Self, as it is sometimes called in \
the East. The only difference between Christ and presence is \
that Christ refers to your indwelling divinity regardless of \
whether you are conscious of it or not, whereas presence \
means your awakened divinity or God-essence. \
\
Many misunderstandings and false beliefs about Christ will \
clear if you realize that there is no past or future in Christ. \
To say that Christ was or will be is a contradiction in terms. \
Jesus was. He was a man who lived two thousand years ago \
and realized divine presence, his true nature. And so he said: \
"Before Abraham was, I am." He did not say: "I already \
existed before Abraham was born." That would have meant \
that he was still within the dimension of time and form iden- \
tity. The words J am used in a sentence that starts in the past \
tense indicate a radical shift, a discontinuity in the temporal \
dimension. It is a Zen-like statement of great profundity. \
Jesus attempted to convey directly, not through discursive \
thought, the meaning of presence, of self-realization. He had \
gone beyond the consciousness dimension governed by \
time, into the realm of the timeless. The dimension of eter- \
nity had come into this world. Eternity, of course, does not \
mean endless time, but no time. Thus, the man Jesus be- \
came Christ, a vehicle for pure consciousness. And what is \
\
\
\
104 \
\
\
\
THE STATE OF PRESENCE \
\
God's self-definition in the Bible? Did God say, "I have \
always been, and I always will be?" Of course not. That \
would have given reality to past and future. God said: "i am \
that i am." No time here, just presence. \
\
The "second coming" of Christ is a transformation of human \
consciousness, a shift from time to presence, from thinking \
to pure consciousness, not the arrival of some man or \
woman. If "Christ" were to return tomorrow in some exter- \
nalized form, what could he or she possibly say to you other \
than this: "I am the Truth. I am divine presence. I am eter- \
nal life. I am within you. I am here. I am Now." \
\
\
\
Never personalize Christ. Don't make Christ into a form \
identity. Avatars, divine mothers, enlightened masters, the \
very few that are real, are not special as persons. Without a \
false self to uphold, defend, and feed, they are more simple, \
more ordinary than the ordinary man or woman. Anyone \
with a strong ego would regard them as insignificant or, \
more likely, not see them at all. \
\
If you are drawn to an enlightened teacher, it is because \
there is already enough presence in you to recognize pres- \
ence in another. There were many people who did not recog- \
nize Jesus or the Buddha, as there are and always have been \
many people who are drawn to false teachers. Egos are \
drawn to bigger egos. Darkness cannot recognize light. Only \
light can recognize light. So don't believe that the light is out- \
side you or that it can only come through one particular \
\
\
\
105 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
form. If only your master is an incarnation of God, then who \
are you? Any kind of exclusivity is identification with form, \
and identifica-tion with form means ego, no matter how well \
disguised. \
\
Use the master's presence to reflect your own identity beyond \
name and form back to you and to become more intensely \
present yourself. You will soon realize that there is no "mine" \
or "yours" in presence. Presence is one. \
\
Group work can also be helpful for intensifying the light of \
your presence. A group of people coming together in a state \
of presence generates a collective energy field of great inten- \
sity. It not only raises the degree of presence of each mem- \
ber of the group but also helps to free the collective human \
consciousness from its current state of mind dominance. \
This will make the state of presence increasingly more acces- \
sible to individuals. However, unless at least one member \
of the group is already firmly established in it and thus can \
hold the energy frequency of that state, the egoic mind can eas- \
ily reassert itself and sabotage the group's endeavors. \
Although group work is invaluable, it is not enough, and you \
must not come to depend on it. Nor must you come to de- \
pend on a teacher or a master, except during the transitional \
period, when you are learning the meaning and practice of \
presence. \

\
CHAPTER SIX \
\
\
\
THE INNER BODY \
\
\
\
BEING IS YOUR DEEPEST SELF \
\
You spoke earlier about the importance of having deep roots \
within or inhabiting the body. Can you explain what you \
meant by that? \
\
The body can become a point of access into the realm of \
Being. Let's go into that more deeply now. \
\
I am still not quite sure if I fully understand what you mean \
by Being. \
\
"Water? What do you mean by that? I don't understand it." \
This is what a fish would say if it had a human mind. \
\
Please stop trying to understand Being. You have already had \
significant glimpses of Being, but the mind will always try to \
squeeze it into a little box and then put a label on it. It can- \
not be done. It cannot become an object of knowledge. In \
Being, subject and object merge into one. \
\
Being can be felt as the ever-present I am that is beyond \
name and form. To feel and thus to know that you are and to \
\
\
\
107 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
abide in that deeply rooted state is enlightenment, is the \
truth that Jesus says will make you free. \
\
Free from what? \
\
Free from the illusion that you are nothing more than your \
physical body and your mind. This "illusion of the self," as the \
Buddha calls it, is the core error. Free from fear in its count- \
less disguises as the inevitable consequence of that illusion \'97 \
the fear that is your constant tormentor as long as you derive \
your sense of self only from this ephemeral and vulnerable \
form. And free from sin, which is the suffering you uncon- \
sciously inflict on yourself and others as long as this illusory \
sense of self governs what you think, say, and do. \
\
LOOK BEYOND THE WORDS \
\
I don't like the word sin. It implies that I am being judged and \
found guilty. \
\
I can understand that. Over the centuries, many erroneous \
views and interpretations have accumulated around words \
such as sin, due to ignorance, misunderstanding, or a desire \
to control, but they contain an essential core of truth. If you \
are unable to look beyond such interpretations and so cannot \
recognize the reality to which the word points, then don't use \
it. Don't get stuck on the level of words. A word is no more \
than a means to an end. It's an abstraction. Not unlike a sign- \
post, it points beyond itself. The word honey isn't honey. You \
can study and talk about honey for as long as you like, but \
you won't really know it until you taste it. After you have tasted \
\
\
\
108 \
\
\
\
THE INNER BODY \
\
\
\
it, the word becomes less important to you. You won't be \
attached to it anymore. Similarly, you can talk or think about \
God continuously for the rest of your life, but does that mean \
you know or have even glimpsed the reality to which the \
word points? It really is no more than an obsessive attach- \
ment to a signpost, a mental idol. \
\
The reverse also applies: If, for whatever reason, you dis- \
liked the word honey, that might prevent you from ever \
tasting it. If you had a strong aversion to the word God, \
which is a negative form of attachment, you may be deny- \
ing not just the word but also the reality to which it points. \
You would be cutting yourself off from the possibility of \
experiencing that reality. All this is, of course, intrinsically \
connected with being identified with your mind. \
\
So, if a word doesn't work for you anymore, then drop it and \
replace it with one that does work. If you don't like the word \
sin, then call it unconsciousness or insanity. That may get \
you closer to the truth, the reality behind the word, than a \
long-misused word like sin, and leaves little room for guilt. \
\
I don't like those words either. They imply that there is some- \
thing wrong with me. I am being judged. \
\
\
\
Of course there is something wrong with you 
\f1 \uc0\u9632 
\f0  \
not being judged. \
\
\
\
and you are \
\
\
\
I don't mean to offend you personally, but do you not belong \
to the human race that killed over one hundred million \
members of its own species in the twentieth century alone? \
\
You mean guilt by association? \
\
\
\
109 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
It is not a question of guilt. But as long as you are run by the \
egoic mind, you are part of the collective insanity. Perhaps \
you haven't looked very deeply into the human condition in \
its state of dominance by the egoic mind. Open your eyes \
and see the fear, the despair, the greed, and the violence that \
are all-pervasive. See the heinous cruelty and suffering on an \
unimaginable scale that humans have inflicted and continue \
to inflict on each other as well as on other life forms on the \
planet. You don't need to condemn. Just observe. That is sin. \
That is insanity. That is unconsciousness. Above all, don't \
forget to observe your own mind. Seek out the root of the \
insanity there. \
\
FINDING YOUR INVISIBLE AND INDESTRUCTIBLE \
REALITY \
\
You said that identification with our physical form is part of the \
illusion, so how can the body, the physical form, bring you to a \
realization of Being? \
\
The body that you can see and touch cannot take you into \
Being. But that visible and tangible body is only an outer \
shell, or rather a limited and distorted perception of a deeper \
reality. In your natural state of connectedness with Being, \
this deeper reality can be felt every moment as the invisible \
inner body, the animating presence within you. So to \
"inhabit the body" is to feel the body from within, to feel the \
life inside the body and thereby come to know that you are \
beyond the outer form. \
\
But that is only the beginning of an inward journey that will \
take you ever more deeply into a realm of great stillness and \
peace, yet also of great power and vibrant life. At first, you \
\
\
\
110 \
\
\
\
THE INNER BODY \
\
\
\
may only get fleeting glimpses of it, but through them you \
will begin to realize that you are not just a meaningless frag- \
ment in an alien universe, briefly suspended between birth \
and death, allowed a few short-lived pleasures followed by \
pain and ultimate annihilation. Underneath your outer form, \
you are connected with something so vast, so immeasurable \
and sacred, that it cannot be conceived or spoken of \'97 yet I \
am speaking of it now. I am speaking of it not to give you \
something to believe in but to show you how you can know \
it for yourself. \
\
You are cut off from Being as long as your mind takes up \
all your attention. When this happens \'97 and it happens \
continuously for most people \'97 you are not in your body. \
The mind absorbs all your consciousness and transforms it \
into mind stuff. You cannot stop thinking. Compulsive \
thinking has become a collective disease. Your whole sense \
of who you are is then derived from mind activity. Your \
identity, as it is no longer rooted in Being, becomes a vul- \
nerable and ever-needy mental construct, which creates fear \
as the predominant underlying emotion. The one thing that \
truly matters is then missing from your life: awareness of \
your deeper self \'97 your invisible and indestructible reality. \
\
To become conscious of Being, you need to reclaim con- \
sciousness from the mind. This is one of the most essential \
tasks on your spiritual journey. It will free vast amounts of \
consciousness that previously had been trapped in useless \
and compulsive thinking. A very effective way of doing this \
is simply to take the focus of your attention away from think- \
ing and direct it into the body, where Being can be felt in the \
first instance as the invisible energy field that gives life to \
what you perceive as the physical body. \
\
\
\

\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
CONNECTING WITH THE INNER BODY \
\
\
\
Please try it now. You may find it helpful to close your eyes \
for this practice. Later on, when "being in the body" has \
become natural and easy, this will no longer be necessary. \
Direct your attention into the body. Feel it from within. Is it \
alive? Is there life in your hands, arms, legs, and feet \'97 in \
your abdomen, your chest? Can you feel the subtle energy \
field that pervades the entire body and gives vibrant life to \
every organ and every cell? Can you feel it simultaneously in \
all parts of the body as a single field of energy? Keep focus- \
ing on the feeling of your inner body for a few moments. Do \
not start to think about it. Feel it. The more attention you \
give it, the clearer and stronger this feeling will become. It \
will feel as if every cell is becoming more alive, and if you \
have a strong visual sense, you may get an image of your \
body becoming luminous. Although such an image can help \
you temporarily, pay more attention to the feeling than to \
any image that may arise. An image, no matter how beauti- \
ful or powerful, is already defined in form, so there is less \
scope for penetrating more deeply. \
\
\
\
The feeling of your inner body is formless, limitless, and \
unfathomable. You can always go into it more deeply. If you \
cannot feel very much at this stage, pay attention to whatever \
you can feel. Perhaps there is just a slight tingling in your \
hands or feet. That's good enough for the moment. Just \
focus on the feeling. Your body is coming alive. Later, we will \
\
\

\

\
\
\
practice some more. Please open your eyes now, but keep \
some attention in the inner energy field of the body even as \
you look around the room. The inner body lies at the thresh- \
old between your form identity and your essence identity, \
your true nature. Never lose touch with it. \
\
\
\
TRANSFORMATION THROUGH THE BODY \
\
Why have most religions condemned or denied the body? It \
seems that spiritual seekers have always regarded the body as \
a hindrance or even as sinful. \
\
Why have so few seekers become finders? \
\
On the level of the body, humans are very close to animals. \
All the basic bodily functions \'97 pleasure, pain, breathing, \
eating, drinking, defecating, sleeping, the drive to find a \
mate and procreate, and of course birth and death \'97 we \
share with the animals. A long time after their fall from a \
state of grace and oneness into illusion, humans suddenly \
woke up in what seemed to be an animal body \'97 and they \
found this very disturbing. "Don't fool yourself. You are no \
more than an animal." This seemed to be the truth that was \
staring them in the face. But it was too disturbing a truth to \
tolerate. Adam and Eve saw that they were naked, and they \
became afraid. Unconscious denial of their animal nature \
set in very quickly. The threat that they might be taken over \
by powerful instinctual drives and revert back to complete \
unconsciousness was indeed a very real one. Shame and \
\
\
\
113 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
taboos appeared around certain parts of the body and bodily \
functions, especially sexuality. The light of their conscious- \
ness was not yet strong enough to make friends with their \
animal nature, to allow it to be and even enjoy that aspect of \
themselves \'97 let alone to go deeply into it to find the divine \
hidden within it, the reality within the illusion. So they did \
what they had to do. They began to disassociate from their \
body. They now saw themselves as having a body, rather than \
just being it. \
\
When religions arose, this disassociation became even \
more pronounced as the "you are not your body" belief. \
Countless people in East and West throughout the ages \
have tried to find God, salvation, or enlightenment through \
denial of the body. This took the form of denial of sense \
pleasures and of sexuality in particular, fasting, and other \
ascetic practices. They even inflicted pain on the body in an \
attempt to weaken or punish it because they regarded it as \
sinful. In Christianity, this used to be called mortification of \
the flesh. Others tried to escape from the body by entering \
trance states or seeking out-of-body experiences. Many still \
do. Even the Buddha is said to have practiced body denial \
through fasting and extreme forms of asceticism for six \
years, but he did not attain enlightenment until after he had \
given up this practice. \
\
The fact is that no one has ever become enlightened through \
denying or fighting the body or through an out-of-body expe- \
rience. Although such an experience can be fascinating and \
can give you a glimpse of the state of liberation from the mat- \
erial form, in the end you will always have to return to the \
body, where the essential work of transformation takes place. \
Transformation is through the body, not away from it. This is \
\
\
\
114 \
\
\
\
THE INNER BODY \
\
why no true master has ever advocated fighting or leaving the \
body, although their mind-based followers often have. \
\
Of the ancient teachings concerning the body, only certain \
fragments survive, such as Jesus's statement that "your \
whole body will be filled with light," or they survive as myths, \
such as the belief that Jesus never relinquished his body but \
remained one with it and ascended into "heaven" with it. \
Almost no one to this day has understood those fragments or \
the hidden meaning of certain myths, and the "you are not \
your body" belief has prevailed universally, leading to body \
denial and attempts to escape from the body. Countless seek- \
ers have thus been prevented from attaining spiritual realiza- \
tion for themselves and becoming finders. \
\
Is it possible to recover the lost teachings on the significance of \
the body or to reconstruct them from the existing fragments? \
\
There is no need for that. All spiritual teachings originate from \
the same Source. In that sense, there is and always has been \
only one master, who manifests in many different forms. I am \
that master, and so are you, once you are able to access the \
Source within. And the way to it is through the inner body. \
Although all spiritual teachings originate from the same \
Source, once they become verbalized and written down they \
are obviously no more than collections of words \'97 and a word \
is nothing but a signpost, as we talked about earlier. All such \
teachings are signposts pointing the way back to the Source. \
\
I have already spoken of the Truth that is hidden within your \
body, but I will summarize for you again the lost teach- \
ings of the masters \'97 so here is another signpost. Please \
endeavor to feel your inner body as you read or listen. \
\
\
\
115 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
SERMON ON THE BODY \
\
What you perceive as a dense physical structure called the \
body, which is subject to disease, old age, and death, is not \
ultimately real \'97 is not you. It is a misperception of your \
essential reality that is beyond birth and death, and is due to \
the limitations of your mind, which, having lost touch with \
Being, creates the body as evidence of its illusory belief in \
separation and to justify its state of fear. But do not turn \
away from the body, for within that symbol of imperma- \
nence, limitation, and death that you perceive as the illusory \
creation of your mind is concealed the splendor of your \
essential and immortal reality. Do not turn your attention \
elsewhere in your search for the Truth, for it is nowhere else \
to be found but within your body. \
\
Do not fight against the body, for in doing so you are fight- \
ing against your own reality. You are your body. The body \
that you can see and touch is only a thin illusory veil. Under- \
neath it lies the invisible inner body, the doorway into Being, \
into Life Unmanifested. Through the inner body, you are \
inseparably connected to this unmanifested One Life \'97 \
birthless, deathless, eternally present. Through the inner \
body, you are forever one with God. \
\
\
\
HAVE DEEP ROOTS WITHIN \
\
\
\
The key is to be in a state of permanent connectedness with \
your inner body \'97 to feel it at all times. This will rapidly \
\
\
\
116 \
\
\
\
THE INNER BODY \
\
deepen and transform your life. The more consciousness \
you direct into the inner body, the higher its vibrational fre- \
quency becomes, much like a light that grows brighter as you \
turn up the dimmer switch and so increase the flow of elec- \
tricity. At this higher energy level, negativity cannot affect \
you anymore, and you tend to attract new circumstances that \
reflect this higher frequency. \
\
If you keep your attention in the body as much as possible, \
you will be anchored in the Now. You won't lose yourself in \
the external world, and you won't lose yourself in your mind. \
Thoughts and emotions, fears and desires, may still be there \
to some extent, but they won't take you over. \
\
Please examine where your attention is at this moment. You \
are listening to me, or you are reading these words in a book. \
That is the focus of your attention. You are also peripherally \
aware of your surroundings, other people, and so on. Fur- \
thermore, there may be some mind activity around what you \
are hearing or reading, some mental commentary. Yet there \
is no need for any of this to absorb all your attention. See if \
you can be in touch with your inner body at the same time. \
Keep some of your attention within. Don't let it all flow out. \
Feel your whole body from within, as a single field of energy. \
It is almost as if you were listening or reading with your \
whole body. Let this be your practice in the days and weeks \
to come. \
\
Do not give all your attention away to the mind and the exter- \
nal world. By all means focus on what you are doing, but feel \
the inner body at the same time whenever possible. Stay \
rooted within. Then observe how this changes your state of \
consciousness and the quality of what you are doing. \
\
\
\
117 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
Whenever you are waiting, wherever it may be, use that time \
to feel the inner body. In this way, traffic jams and lines be- \
come very enjoyable. Instead of mentally projecting yourself \
away from the Now, go more deeply into the Now by going \
more deeply into the body. \
\
The art of inner-body awareness will develop into a com- \
pletely new way of living, a state of permanent connected- \
ness with Being, and will add a depth to your life that you \
have never known before. \
\
It is easy to stay present as the observer of your mind when \
you are deeply rooted within your body. No matter what hap- \
pens on the outside, nothing can shake you anymore. \
\
Unless you stay present \'97 and inhabiting your body is \
always an essential aspect of it \'97 you will continue to be run \
by your mind. The script in your head that you learned a long \
time ago, the conditioning of your mind, will dictate your \
thinking and your behavior. You may be free of it for brief \
intervals, but rarely for long. This is especially true when \
something "goes wrong" or there is some loss or upset. Your \
conditioned reaction will then be involuntary, automatic, and \
predictable, fueled by the one basic emotion that underlies \
the mind-identified state of consciousness: fear. \
\
So when such challenges come, as they always do, make it a \
habit to go within at once and focus as much as you can on \
the inner energy field of your body. This need not take long, \
just a few seconds. But you need to do it the moment that \
the challenge presents itself. Any delay will allow a condi- \
tioned mental-emotional reaction to arise and take you over. \
When you focus within and feel the inner body, you imme- \
diately become still and present as you are withdrawing \
\
\
\
118 \
\
\
\
THE INNER BODY \
\
\
\
consciousness from the mind. If a response is required in \
that situation, it will come up from this deeper level. Just as \
the sun is infinitely brighter than a candle flame, there is \
infinitely more intelligence in Being than in your mind. \
\
As long as you are in conscious contact with your inner body, \
you are like a tree that is deeply rooted in the earth, or a \
building with a deep and solid foundation. The latter analogy \
is used by Jesus in the generally misunderstood parable of \
the two men who build a house. One man builds it on the \
sand, without a foundation, and when the storms and floods \
come, the house is swept away. The other man digs deep \
until he reaches the rock, then builds his house, which is not \
swept away by the floods. \
\
BEFORE YOU ENTER THE BODY, FORGIVE \
\
I felt very uncomfortable when I tried to put my attention on \
the inner body. There was a feeling of agitation and some nau- \
sea. So I haven't been able to experience what you are talking \
about. \
\
What you felt was a lingering emotion that you were probably \
unaware of, until you started putting some attention into the \
body. Unless you first give it some attention, the emotion will \
prevent you from gaining access to the inner body, which lies \
at a deeper level underneath it. Attention does not mean that \
you start thinking about it. It means to just observe the emo- \
tion, to feel it fully, and so to acknowledge and accept it as it \
is. Some emotions are easily identified: anger, fear, grief, and \
so on. Others may be much harder to label. They may just be \
vague feelings of unease, heaviness, or constriction, halfway \
between an emotion and a physical sensation. In any case, \
\
\
\
119 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
what matters is not whether you can attach a mental label to \
it but whether you can bring the feeling of it into awareness \
as much as possible. Attention is the key to transformation \'97 \
and full attention also implies acceptance. Attention is like a \
beam of light \'97 the focused power of your consciousness \
that transmutes everything into itself. \
\
In a fully functional organism, an emotion has a very short \
life span. It is like a momentary ripple or wave on the sur- \
face of your Being. When you are not in your body, how- \
ever, an emotion can survive inside you for days or weeks, \
or join with other emotions of a similar frequency that have \
merged and become the pain-body, a parasite that can live \
inside you for years, feed on your energy, lead to physical \
illness, and make your life miserable (see chapter 2). \
\
So place your attention on feeling the emotion, and check \
whether your mind is holding on to a grievance pattern such \
as blame, self-pity, or resentment that is feeding the emotion. \
If that is the case, it means that you haven't forgiven. Non- \
forgiveness is often toward another person or yourself, but it \
may just as well be toward any situation or condition \'97 past, \
present, or future \'97 that your mind refuses to accept. Yes, \
there can be nonforgiveness even with regard to the future. \
This is the mind's refusal to accept uncertainty, to accept that \
the future is ultimately beyond its control. Forgiveness is to \
relinquish your grievance and so to let go of grief. It happens \
naturally once you realize that your grievance serves no pur- \
pose except to strengthen a false sense of self. Forgiveness is \
to offer no resistance to life \'97 to allow life to live through you. \
The alternatives are pain and suffering, a greatly restricted \
flow of life energy, and in many cases physical disease. \
\
\
\
120 \
\
\
\
THE INNER BODY \
\
\
\
The moment you truly forgive, you have reclaimed your power \
from the mind. Nonforgiveness is the very nature of the mind, \
just as the mind-made false self, the ego, cannot survive with- \
out strife and conflict. The mind cannot forgive. Only you can. \
You become present, you enter your body, you feel the vibrant \
peace and stillness that emanate from Being. That is why Jesus \
said: "Before you enter the temple, forgive." \
\
\
\
YOUR LINK WITH THE UNMANIFESTED \
\
What is the relationship between presence and the inner body? \
\
Presence is pure consciousness \'97 consciousness that has \
been reclaimed from the mind, from the world of form. The \
inner body is your link with the Unmanifested, and in its \
deepest aspect is the Unmanifested: the Source from which \
consciousness emanates, as light emanates from the sun. \
Awareness of the inner body is consciousness remembering \
its origin and returning to the Source. \
\
Is the Unmanifested the same as Being? \
\
Yes. The word Unmanifested attempts, by way of negation, to \
express That which cannot be spoken, thought, or imagined. \
It points to what it is by saying what it is not. Being, on the \
other hand, is a positive term. Please don't get attached to \
either of these words or start believing in them. They are no \
more than signposts. \
\
\
\
121 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
You said that presence is consciousness that has been re- \
claimed from the mind. Who does the reclaiming? \
\
You do. But since in your essence you are consciousness, we \
might as well say that it is an awakening of consciousness \
from the dream of form. This does not mean that your own \
form will instantly vanish in an explosion of light. You can \
continue in your present form yet be aware of the formless \
and deathless deep within you. \
\
/ must admit that this is way beyond my comprehension, and \
yet on some deeper level I seem to know what you are talking \
about. It's more like a feeling than anything else. Am I deceiv- \
ing myself? \
\
No, you are not. Feeling will get you closer to the truth of \
who you are than thinking. I cannot tell you anything that \
deep within you don't already know. When you have reached \
a certain stage of inner connectedness, you recognize the \
truth when you hear it. If you haven't reached that stage yet, \
the practice of body awareness will bring about the deepen- \
ing that is necessary. \
\
SLOWING DOWN THE AGING PROCESS \
\
In the meantime, awareness of the inner body has other ben- \
efits in the physical realm. One of them is a significant slow- \
ing down of the aging of the physical body. \
\
Whereas the outer body normally appears to grow old and \
wither fairly quickly, the inner body does not change with \
time, except that you may feel it more deeply and become it \
more fully. If you are twenty years old now, the energy field of \
\
\
\
122 \
\
\
\
THE INNER BODY \
\
your inner body will feel just the same when you are eighty. \
It will be just as vibrantly alive. As soon as your habitual state \
changes from being out of the body and trapped in your mind \
to being in the body and present in the Now, your physical \
body will feel lighter, clearer, more alive. As there is more \
consciousness in the body, its molecular structure actually \
becomes less dense. More consciousness means a lessening \
of the illusion of materiality. \
\
When you become identified more with the timeless inner \
body than with the outer body, when presence becomes your \
normal mode of consciousness and past and future no \
longer dominate your attention, you do not accumulate time \
anymore in your psyche and in the cells of the body. The \
accumulation of time as the psychological burden of past \
and future greatly impairs the cells' capacity for self-renewal. \
So if you inhabit the inner body, the outer body will grow old \
at a much slower rate, and even when it does, your timeless \
essence will shine through the outer form, and you will not \
give the appearance of an old person. \
\
Is there any scientific evidence for this? \
\
Try it out and you will be the evidence. \
\
STRENGTHENING THE IMMUNE SYSTEM \
\
Another benefit of this practice in the physical realm is a great \
strengthening of the immune system, which occurs when you \
inhabit the body. The more consciousness you bring into the \
body, the stronger the immune system, becomes. It is as if \
every cell awakens and rejoices. The body loves your atten- \
tion. It is also a potent form of self-healing. Most illnesses \
\
\
\
123 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
creep in when you are not present in the body. If the master \
is not present in the house, all kinds of shady characters will \
take up residence there. When you inhabit your body, it will be \
hard for unwanted guests to enter. \
\
It is not only your physical immune system that becomes \
strengthened; your psychic immune system is greatly \
enhanced as well. The latter protects you from the negative \
mental-emotional force fields of others, which are highly con- \
tagious. Inhabiting the body protects you not by putting up a \
shield, but by raising the frequency vibration of your total \
energy field, so that anything that vibrates at a lower fre- \
quency, such as fear, anger, depression, and so on, now exists \
in what is virtually a different order of reality. It doesn't enter \
your field of consciousness anymore, or if it does you don't \
need to offer any resistance to it because it passes right \
through you. Please don't just accept or reject what I am say- \
ing. Put it to the test. \
\
There is a simple but powerful self-healing meditation that \
you can do whenever you feel the need to boost your immune \
system. It is particularly effective if used when you feel the \
first symptoms of an illness, but it also works with illnesses \
that are already entrenched if you use it at frequent intervals \
and with an intense focus. It will also counteract any dis- \
ruption of your energy field by some form of negativity. \
However, it is not a substitute for the moment-to-moment \
practice of being in the body; otherwise, its effect will only be \
temporary. Here it is. \
\
When you are unoccupied for a few minutes, and especially \
last thing at night before falling asleep and first thing in \
the morning before getting up, "flood" your body with con- \
sciousness. Close your eyes. Lie flat on your back. Choose \
\
\
\
124 \
\
\
\
THE INNER BODY \
\
\
\
different parts of your body to focus your attention on briefly \
at first: hands, feet, arms, legs, abdomen, chest, head, and so \
on. Feel the life energy inside those parts as intensely as you \
can. Stay with each part for fifteen seconds or so. Then let \
your attention run through the body like a wave a few times, \
from feet to head and back again. This need only take a \
minute or so. After that, feel the inner body in its totality, as \
a single field of energy. Hold that feeling for a few minutes. \
Be intensely present during that time, present in every cell \
of your body. Don't be concerned if the mind occasionally \
succeeds in drawing your attention out of the body and you \
lose yourself in some thought. As soon as you notice that this \
has happened, just return your attention to the inner body. \
\
LET THE BREATH TAKE YOU INTO THE BODY \
\
At times, when my mind has been very active, it has acquired \
such momentum that I find it impossible to take my attention \
away from it and feel the inner body. This happens particu- \
larly when I get into a worry or anxiety pattern. Do you have \
any suggestions? \
\
If at any time you are finding it hard to get in touch with the \
inner body, it is usually easier to focus on your breathing \
first. Conscious breathing, which is a powerful meditation in \
its own right, will gradually put you in touch with the body. \
Follow the breath with your attention as it moves in and out \
of your body. Breathe into the body, and feel your abdomen \
expanding and contracting slightly with each inhalation and \
exhalation. If you find it easy to visualize, close your eyes \
and see yourself surrounded by light or immersed in a lumi- \
nous substance \'97 a sea of consciousness. Then breathe in \
\
\
\
125 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
that light. Feel that luminous substance filling up your body \
and making it luminous also. Then gradually focus more on \
the feeling. You are now in your body. Don't get attached to \
any visual image. \
\
\
\
CREATIVE USE OF MIND \
\
If you need to use your mind for a specific purpose, use it in \
conjunction with your inner body. Only if you are able to be \
conscious without thought can you use your mind creatively, \
and the easiest way to enter that state is through your body. \
Whenever an answer, a solution, or a creative idea is needed, \
stop thinking for a moment by focusing attention on your \
inner energy field. Become aware of the stillness. When you \
resume thinking, it will be fresh and creative. In any thought \
activity, make it a habit to go back and forth every few min- \
utes or so between thinking and an inner kind of listening, \
an inner stillness. We could say: don't just think with your \
head, think with your whole body. \
\
\
\
THE ART OF LISTENING \
\
\
\
When listening to another person, don't just listen with your \
mind, listen with your whole body. Feel the energy field of \
\
\
\
126 \
\
\
\
THE INNER BODY \
\
\
\
your inner body as you listen. That takes attention away from \
thinking and creates a still space that enables you to truly lis- \
ten without the mind interfering. You are giving the other \
person space \'97 space to be. It is the most precious gift you \
can give. Most people don't know how to listen because the \
major part of their attention is taken up by thinking. They \
pay more attention to that than to what the other person is \
saying, and none at all to what really matters: the Being \
of the other person underneath the words and the mind. Of \
course, you cannot feel someone else's Being except through \
your own. This is the beginning of the realization of one- \
ness, which is love. At the deepest level of Being, you are one \
with all that is. \
\
Most human relationships consist mainly of minds interact- \
ing with each other, not of human beings communicating, \
being in communion. No relationship can thrive in that way, \
and that is why there is so much conflict in relationships. \
When the mind is running your life, conflict, strife, and \
problems are inevitable. Being in touch with your inner body \
creates a clear space of no-mind within which the relation- \
ship can flower. \

CHAPTER SEVEN \
\
\
\
PORTALS INTO \
THE UNMANIFESTED \
\
\
\
GOING DEEPLY INTO THE BODY \
\
I can feel the energy inside my body, especially in my arms \
and legs, but I don't seem to be able to go more deeply, as you \
suggested earlier. \
\
Make it into a meditation. It needn't take long. Ten to fifteen \
minutes of clock time should be sufficient. Make sure first \
that there are no external distractions such as telephones or \
people who are likely to interrupt you. Sit on a chair, but \
don't lean back. Keep the spine erect. Doing so will help you \
to stay alert. Alternatively, choose your own favorite position \
for meditation. \
\
Make sure the body is relaxed. Close your eyes. Take a few \
deep breaths. Feel yourself breathing into the lower abdo- \
men, as it were. Observe how it expands and contracts \
slightly with each in and out breath. Then become aware of \
the entire inner energy field of the body. Don't think about it \
\'97 feel it. By doing this, you reclaim consciousness from the \
mind. If you find it helpful, use the "light" visualization I \
described earlier. \
\
\
\
129 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
When you can feel the inner body clearly as a single field of \
energy, let go, if possible, of any visual image and focus \
exclusively on the feeling. If you can, also drop any mental \
image you may still have of the physical body. All that is left \
then is an all-encompassing sense of presence or "being- \
ness," and the inner body is felt to be without a boundary. \
Then take your attention even more deeply into that feeling. \
Become one with it. Merge with the energy field, so that \
there is no longer a perceived duality of the observer and the \
observed, of you and your body. The distinction between \
inner and outer also dissolves now, so there is no inner body \
anymore. By going deeply into the body, you have tran- \
scended the body. \
\
Stay in this realm of pure Being for as long as feels comfort- \
able; then become aware again of the physical body, your \
breathing and physical senses, and open your eyes. Look at \
your surroundings for a few minutes in a meditative way \'97 \
that is, without labeling them mentally \'97 and continue to \
feel the inner body as you do so. \
\
\
\
Having access to that formless realm is truly liberating. It \
frees you from bondage to form and identification with form. \
It is life in its undifferentiated state prior to its fragmentation \
into multiplicity. We may call it the Unmanifested, the invi- \
sible Source of all things, the Being within all beings. It is a \
realm of deep stillness and peace, but also of joy and intense \
aliveness. Whenever you are present, you become "transpar- \
ent" to some extent to the light, the pure consciousness that \
\
\
\
130 \
\
\
\
PORTALS INTO THE UNMANIFESTED \
\
emanates from this Source. You also realize that the light \
is not separate from who you are but constitutes your very \
essence. \
\
THE SOURCE OF CHI \
\
Is the Unmanifested what in the East is called chi, a kind of \
universal life energy? \
\
No, it isn't. The Unmanifested is the source of chi. Chi is the \
inner energy field of your body. It is the bridge between \
the outer you and the Source. It lies halfway between the \
manifested, the world of form, and the Unmanifested. Chi \
can be likened to a river or an energy stream. If you take the \
focus of your consciousness deeply into the inner body, you \
are tracing the course of this river back to its Source. Chi is \
movement; the Unmanifested is stillness. When you reach a \
point of absolute stillness, which is nevertheless vibrant with \
life, you have gone beyond the inner body and beyond chi \
to the Source itself: the Unmanifested. Chi is the link be- \
tween the Unmanifested and the physical universe. \
\
So if you take your attention deeply into the inner body, you \
may reach this point, this singularity, where the world dis- \
solves into the Unmanifested and the Unmanifested takes \
on form as the energy stream of chi, which then becomes the \
world. This is the point of birth and death. When your con- \
sciousness is directed outward, mind and world arise. When \
it is directed inward, it realizes its own Source and returns \
home into the Unmanifested. Then, when your conscious- \
ness comes back to the manifested world, you reassume the \
form identity that you temporarily relinquished. You have a \
name, a past, a life situation, a future. But in one essential \
\
\
\
131 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
respect, you are not the same person you were before: You \
will have glimpsed a reality within yourself that is not "of this \
world," although it isn't separate from it, just as it isn't sep- \
arate from you. \
\
Now let your spiritual practice be this: As you go about your \
life, don't give ioo percent of your attention to the external \
world and to your mind. Keep some within. I have spoken \
about this already. Feel the inner body even when engaged in \
everyday activities, especially when engaged in relationships \
or when you are relating with nature. Feel the stillness deep \
inside it. Keep the portal open. It is quite possible to be con- \
scious of the Unmanifested throughout your life. You feel it \
as a deep sense of peace somewhere in the background, a \
stillness that never leaves you, no matter what happens out \
here. You become a bridge between the Unmanifested and \
the manifested, between God and the world. This is the state \
of connectedness with the Source that we call enlightenment. \
\
Don't get the impression that the Unmanifested is separate \
from the manifested. How could it be? It is the life within \
every form, the inner essence of all that exists. It pervades \
this world. Let me explain. \
\
DREAMLESS SLEEP \
\
You take a journey into the Unmanifested every night when \
you enter the phase of deep dreamless sleep. You merge with \
the Source. You draw from it the vital energy that sustains \
you for a while when you return to the manifested, the world \
of separate forms. This energy is much more vital than \
food: "Man does not live by bread alone." But in dreamless \
sleep, you don't go into it consciously. Although the bodily \
\
\
\
132 \
\
\
\
PORTALS INTO THE UNMANIFESTED \
\
functions are still operating, "you" no longer exist in that \
state. Can you imagine what it would be like to go into \
dreamless sleep with full consciousness? It is impossible to \
imagine it, because that state has no content. \
\
The Unmanifested does not liberate you until you enter it \
consciously. That's why Jesus did not say: the truth will \
make you free, but rather: "You will know the truth, and the \
truth will make you free." This is not a conceptual truth. It is \
the truth of eternal life beyond form, which is known directly \
or not at all. But don't attempt to stay conscious in dreamless \
sleep. It is highly unlikely that you will succeed. At most, you \
may remain conscious during the dream phase, but not \
beyond that. This is called lucid dreaming, which may be \
interesting and fascinating, but it is not liberating. \
\
So use your inner body as a portal through which you enter \
the Unmanifested, and keep that portal open so that you stay \
connected with the Source at all times. It makes no differ- \
ence, as far as the inner body is concerned, whether your \
outer physical body is old or young, frail or strong. The inner \
body is timeless. If you are not yet able to feel the inner body, \
use one of the other portals, although ultimately they are all \
one. Some I have spoken about at length already, but I'll \
mention them again briefly here. \
\
OTHER PORTALS \
\
The Now can be seen as the main portal. It is an essential aspect \
of every other portal, including the inner body. You cannot be \
in your body without being intensely present in the Now. \
\
Time and the manifested are as inextricably linked as are the \
timeless Now and the Unmanifested. When you dissolve \
\
\
\
133 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
psychological time through intense present-moment aware- \
ness, you become conscious of the Unmanifested both \
directly and indirectly. Directly, you feel it as the radiance \
and power of your conscious presence \'97 no content, just \
presence. Indirectly, you are aware of the Unmanifested in \
and through the sensory realm. In other words, you feel the \
God-essence in every creature, every flower, every stone, and \
you realize: "All that is, is holy." This is why Jesus, speaking \
entirely from his essence or Christ identity, says in the \
Gospel of Thomas: "Split a piece of wood; I am there. Lift up \
a stone, and you will find me there." \
\
Another portal into the Unmanifested is created through the \
cessation of thinking. This can start with a very simple thing, \
such as taking one conscious breath or looking, in a state of \
intense alertness, at a flower, so that there is no mental com- \
mentary running at the same time. There are many ways to \
create a gap in the incessant stream of thought. This is what \
meditation is all about. Thought is part of the realm of the \
manifested. Continuous mind activity keeps you imprisoned \
in the world of form and becomes an opaque screen that \
prevents you from becoming conscious of the Unmani- \
fested, conscious of the formless and timeless God-essence \
in yourself and in all things and all creatures. When you are \
intensely present, you don't need to be concerned about the \
cessation of thinking, of course, because the mind then stops \
automatically. That's why I said the Now is an essential aspect \
of every other portal. \
\
Surrender \'97 the letting go of mental-emotional resistance to \
what is \'97 also becomes a portal into the Unmanifested. The \
reason for this is simple: inner resistance cuts you off from \
other people, from yourself, from the world around you. It \
\
\
\
134 \
\
\
\
PORTALS INTOTHE UNMANIFESTED \
\
strengthens the feeling of separateness on which the ego \
depends for its survival. The stronger the feeling of separate- \
ness, the more you are bound to the manifested, to the world \
of separate forms. The more you are bound to the world of \
form, the harder and more impenetrable your form identity \
becomes. The portal is closed, and you are cut off from the \
inner dimension, the dimension of depth. In the state of sur- \
render, your form identity softens and becomes somewhat \
"transparent," as it were, so the Unmanifested can shine \
through you. \
\
It's up to you to open a portal in your life that gives you con- \
scious access to the Unmanifested. Get in touch with the \
energy field of the inner body, be intensely present, disiden- \
tify from the mind, surrender to what is; these are all portals \
you can use \'97 but you only need to use one. \
\
Surely love must also be one of those portals? \
\
No, it isn't. As soon as one of the portals is open, love is pres- \
ent in you as the "feeling-realization" of oneness. Love isn't \
a portal; it's what comes through the portal into this world. \
As long as you are completely trapped in your form identity, \
there can be no love. Your task is not to search for love but \
to find a portal through which love can enter. \
\
SILENCE \
\
Are there any other portals apart from those you just men- \
tioned? \
\
Yes, there are. The Unmanifested is not separate from the \
manifested. It pervades this world, but it is so well disguised \
\
\
\
135 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
that almost everybody misses it completely. If you know \
where to look, you'll find it everywhere. A portal opens up \
every moment. \
\
Do you hear that dog barking in the distance? Or that car \
passing by? Listen carefully. Can you feel the presence of the \
Unmanifested in that? You can't? Look for it in the silence out \
of which the sounds come and into which they return. Pay \
more attention to the silence than to the sounds. Paying atten- \
tion to outer silence creates inner silence: the mind becomes \
still. A portal is opening up. \
\
Every sound is born out of silence, dies back into silence, and \
during its life span is surrounded by silence. Silence enables \
the sound to be. It is an intrinsic but unmanifested part of \
every sound, every musical note, every song, every word. The \
Unmanifested is present in this world as silence. This is why \
it has been said that nothing in this world is so like God as \
silence. All you have to do is pay attention to it. Even during \
a conversation, become conscious of the gaps between words, \
the brief silent intervals between sentences. As you do that, the \
dimension of stillness grows within you. You cannot pay atten- \
tion to silence without simultaneously becoming still with- \
in. Silence without, stillness within. You have entered the \
Unmanifested. \
\
SPACE \
\
fust as no sound can exist without silence, nothing can exist \
without no-thing, without the empty space that enables it to \
be. Every physical object or body has come out of nothing, is \
surrounded by nothing, and will eventually return to nothing. \
Not only that, but even inside every physical body there is far \
\
\
\
136 \
\
\
\
PORTALS INTO THE UNMANIFESTED \
\
more "nothing" than "something." Physicists tell us that the \
solidity of matter is an illusion. Even seemingly solid matter, \
including your physical body, is nearly ioo percent empty \
space \'97 so vast are the distances between the atoms compared \
to their size. What is more, even inside every atom there is \
mostly empty space. What is left is more like a vibrational fre- \
quency than particles of solid matter, more like a musical note. \
Buddhists have known that for over 2,500 years. "Form is \
emptiness, emptiness is form," states the Heart Sutra, one of \
the best known ancient Buddhist texts. The essence of all \
things is emptiness. \
\
The Unmanifested is not only present in this world as silence; \
it also pervades the entire physical universe as space \'97 from \
within and without. This is just as easy to miss as silence. \
Everybody pays attention to the things in space, but who pays \
attention to space itself? \
\
You seem to be implying that "emptiness" or "nothing" is not \
just nothing, that there is some mysterious quality to it. What \
is this nothing? \
\
You cannot ask such a question. Your mind is trying to make \
nothing into something. The moment you make it into \
something, you have missed it. Nothing \'97 space \'97 is the \
appearance of the Unmanifested as an externalized phenom- \
enon in a sense-perceived world. That's about as much as \
one can say about it, and even that is a kind of paradox. It can- \
not become an object of knowledge. You can't do a Ph.D. on \
"nothing." When scientists study space, they usually make it \
into something and thereby miss its essence entirely. Not sur- \
prisingly, the latest theory is that space isn't empty at all, that \
it is filled with some substance. Once you have a theory, it's \
\
\
\
137 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
not too hard to find evidence to substantiate it, at least until \
some other theory comes along. \
\
"Nothing" can only become a portal into the Unmanifested \
for you if you don't try to grasp or understand it. \
\
Isn't that what we are doing here? \
\
Not at all. I am giving you pointers to show you how you can \
bring the dimension of the Unmanifested into your life. We \
are not trying to understand it. There is nothing to under- \
stand. \
\
Space has no "existence." "To exist" literally means "to stand \
out." You cannot understand space because it doesn't stand \
out. Although in itself it has no existence, it enables every- \
thing else to exist. Silence has no existence either, nor does \
the Un-manifested. \
\
So what happens if you withdraw attention from the objects \
in space and become aware of space itself? What is the \
essence of this room? The furniture, pictures, and so on are \
in the room, but they are not the room. The floor, walls, and \
ceiling define the boundary of the room, but they are not the \
room either. So what is the essence of the room? Space, of \
course, empty space. There would be no "room" without it. \
Since space is "nothing," we can say that what is not there is \
more important than what is there. So become aware of the \
space that is all around you. Don't think about it. Feel it, as \
it were. Pay attention to "nothing." \
\
As you do that, a shift in consciousness takes place inside \
you. Here is why. The inner equivalent to objects in space \
such as furniture, walls, and so on are your mind objects: \
\
\
\
138 \
\
\
\
PORTALS INTOTHE UNMANIFESTED \
\
thoughts, emotions, and the objects of the senses. And the \
inner equivalent of space is the consciousness that enables \
your mind objects to be, just as space allows all things to \
be. So if you withdraw attention from things \'97 objects in \
space \'97 you automatically withdraw attention from your \
mind objects as well. In other words: You cannot think and \
be aware of space \'97 or of silence, for that matter. By be- \
coming aware of the empty space around you, you simulta- \
neously become aware of the space of no-mind, of pure \
consciousness: the Unmanifested. This is how the contem- \
plation of space can become a portal for you. \
\
Space and silence are two aspects of the same thing, the \
same no-thing. They are an externalization of inner space \
and inner silence, which is stillness: the infinitely creative \
womb of all existence. Most humans are completely uncon- \
scious of this dimension. There is no inner space, no still- \
ness. They are out of balance. In other words, they know the \
world, or think they do, but they don't know God. They iden- \
tify exclusively with their own physical and psychological \
form, unconscious of essence. And because every form is \
highly unstable, they live in fear. This fear causes a deep mis- \
perception of themselves and of other humans, a distortion \
in their vision of the world. \
\
If some cosmic convulsion brought about the end of our \
world, the Unmanifested would remain totally unaffected by \
this. A Course in Miracles expresses this truth poignantly: \
"Nothing real can be threatened. Nothing unreal exists. \
Herein lies the peace of God." \
\
If you remain in conscious connection with the Unmani- \
fested, you value, love, and deeply respect the manifested \
and every life form in it as an expression of the One Life \
\
\
\
139 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
beyond form. You also know that every form is destined to \
dissolve again and that ultimately nothing out here matters \
all that much. You have "overcome the world," in the words \
of Jesus, or, as the Buddha put it, you have "crossed over to \
the other shore." \
\
THE TRUE NATURE OF SPACE AND TIME \
\
Now consider this: If there were nothing but silence, it \
wouldn't exist for you; you wouldn't know what it is. Only \
when sound appears does silence come into being. Similarly, \
if there were only space without any objects in space, it \
wouldn't exist for you. Imagine yourself as a point of con- \
sciousness floating in the vastness of space \'97 no stars, no \
galaxies, just emptiness. Suddenly, space wouldn't be vast \
anymore; it would not be there at all. There would be no \
speed, no movement from here to there. At least two points \
of reference are needed for distance and space to come into \
being. Space comes into being the moment the One becomes \
two, and as "two" become the "ten thousand things," as Lao \
Tse calls the manifested world, space becomes more and \
more vast. So world and space arise simultaneously. \
\
Nothing could be without space, yet space is nothing. \
Before the universe came into being, before the "big bang," \
if you like, there wasn't a vast empty space waiting to be \
filled. There was no space, as there was no thing. There \
was only the Unmanifested \'97 the One. When the One \
became "the ten thousand things," suddenly space seemed \
to be there and enabled the many to be. Where did it come \
from? Was it created by God to accommodate the uni- \
verse? Of course not. Space is no-thing, so it was never \
created. \
\
\
\
140 \

\
\
PORTALS INTO THE UNMANIFESTED \
\
Go out on a clear night and look up at the sky. The thousands \
of stars you can see with the naked eye are no more than an \
infinitesimal fraction of what is there. Over ioo billion galax- \
ies can already be detected with the most powerful tele- \
scopes, each galaxy an "island universe" with billions of stars. \
Yet what is even more awe-inspiring is the infinity of space \
itself, the depth and stillness that allows all of that magni- \
ficence to be. Nothing could be more awe-inspiring and \
majestic than the inconceivable vastness and stillness of \
space, and yet what is it? Emptiness, vast emptiness. \
\
What appears to us as space in our universe perceived \
through the mind and the senses is the Unmanifested itself, \
externalized. It is the "body" of God. And the greatest mir- \
acle is this: That stillness and vastness that enables the uni- \
verse to be is not just out there in space \'97 it is also within \
you. When you are utterly and totally present, you encounter \
it as the still inner space of no-mind. Within you, it is vast in \
depth, not in extension. Spacial extension is ultimately a \
misperception of infinite depth \'97 an attribute of the one \
transcendental reality. \
\
According to Einstein, space and time are not separate. I don't \
really understand it, but I think he is saying that time is the fourth \
dimension of space. He calls it the "space-time continuum." \
\
Yes. What you perceive externally as space and time are ulti- \
mately illusory, but they contain a core of truth. They are the \
two essential attributes of God, infinity and eternity, per- \
ceived as if they had an external existence outside you. Within \
you, both space and time have an inner equivalent that reveals \
their true nature, as well as your own. Whereas space is the \
still, infinitely deep realm of no-mind, the inner equivalent of \
\
\
\
141 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
time is presence, awareness of the eternal Now. Remember \
that there is no distinction between them. When space and \
time are realized within as the Unmanifested \'97 no-mind \
and presence \'97 external space and time continue to exist for \
you, but they become much less important. The world, too, \
continues to exist for you, but it will not bind you anymore. \
\
Hence, the ultimate purpose of the world lies not within \
the world but in transcendence of the world. Just as you \
would not be conscious of space if there were no objects \
in space, the world is needed for the Unmanifested to \
be realized. You may have heard the Buddhist saying: "If \
there were no illusion, there would be no enlightenment." \
It is through the world and ultimately through you that \
the Unmanifested knows itself. You are here to enable the \
divine purpose of the universe to unfold. That is how \
important you are! \
\
CONSCIOUS DEATH \
\
Apart from dreamless sleep, which I mentioned already, \
there is one other involuntary portal. It opens up briefly at \
the time of physical death. Even if you have missed all the \
other opportunities for spiritual realization during your life- \
time, one last portal will open up for you immediately after \
the body has died. \
\
There are countless accounts by people who had a visual \
impression of this portal as radiant light and then returned \
from what is commonly known as a near-death experience. \
Many of them also spoke of a sense of blissful serenity and \
deep peace. In the Tibetan Book of the Dead, it is described as \
"the luminous splendor of the colorless light of Emptiness," \
\
\
\
142 \
\
\
\
PORTALS INTOTHE UNMANIFESTED \
\
which it says is "your own true self." This portal opens up \
only very briefly, and unless you have already encountered \
the dimension of the Unmanifested in your lifetime, you will \
likely miss it. Most people carry too much residual resis- \
tance, too much fear, too much attachment to sensory expe- \
rience, too much identification with the manifested world. \
So they see the portal, turn away in fear, and then lose con- \
sciousness. Most of what happens after that is involuntary \
and automatic. Eventually, there will be another round of \
birth and death. Their presence wasn't strong enough yet for \
conscious immortality. \
\
So going through this portal does not mean annihilation? \
\
As with all the other portals, your radiant true nature re- \
mains, but not the personality. In any case, whatever is real or \
of true value in your personality is your true nature shining \
through. This is never lost. Nothing that is of value, nothing \
that is real, is ever lost. \
\
Approaching death and death itself, the dissolution of the \
physical form, is always a great opportunity for spiritual real- \
ization. This opportunity is tragically missed most of the \
time, since we live in a culture that is almost totally ignorant \
of death, as it is almost totally ignorant of anything that truly \
matters. \
\
Every portal is a portal of death, the death of the false self. \
When you go through it, you cease to derive your identity \
from your psychological, mind-made form. You then realize \
that death is an illusion, just as your identification with form \
was an illusion. The end of illusion \'97 that's all that death is. \
It is painful only as long as you cling to illusion. \

\
\
\
ENTER THE NOW FROM WHEREVER YOU ARE \
\
I always thought that true enlightenment is not possible except \
through love in a relationship between a man and a woman. \
Isn't this what makes us whole again? How can one's life be ful- \
filled until that happens? \
\
Is that true in your experience? Has this happened to you? \
\
Not yet, but how could it be otherwise? I know that it will \
happen. \
\
In other words, you are waiting for an event in time to save \
you. Is this not the core error that we have been talking \
about? Salvation is not elsewhere in place or time. It is here \
and now. \
\
What does that statement mean, "salvation is here and now"? \
I don't understand it. I don't even know what salvation means. \
\
Most people pursue physical pleasures or various forms of \
psychological gratification because they believe that those \
\
\
\
145 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
things will make them happy or free them from a feeling of \
fear or lack. Happiness may be perceived as a heightened \
sense of aliveness attained through physical pleasure, or a \
more secure and more complete sense of self attained \
through some form of psychological gratification. This is the \
search for salvation from a state of unsatisfactoriness or \
insufficiency. Invariably, any satisfaction that they obtain is \
short-lived, so the condition of satisfaction or fulfillment \
is usually projected once again onto an imaginary point away \
from the here and now. "When I obtain this or am free of \
that \'97 then I will be okay." This is the unconscious mind- \
set that creates the illusion of salvation in the future. \
\
True salvation is fulfillment, peace, life in all its fullness. It \
is to be who you are, to feel within you the good that has no \
opposite, the joy of Being that depends on nothing outside \
itself. It is felt not as a passing experience but as an abiding \
presence. In theistic language, it is to "know God" \'97 not as \
something outside you but as your own innermost essence. \
True salvation is to know yourself as an inseparable part of \
the timeless and formless One Life from which all that exists \
derives its being. \
\
True salvation is a state of freedom \'97 from fear, from suf- \
fering, from a perceived state of lack and insufficiency and \
therefore from all wanting, needing, grasping, and clinging. \
It is freedom from compulsive thinking, from negativity, and \
above all from past and future as a psychological need. Your \
mind is telling you that you cannot get there from here. Some- \
thing needs to happen, or you need to become this or that \
before you can be free and fulfilled. It is saying, in fact, \
that you need time \'97 that you need to find, sort out, do, \
achieve, acquire, become, or understand something before \
\
\
\
146 \
\
\
\
ENLIGHTENED RELATIONSHIPS \
\
you can be free or complete. You see time as the means to \
salvation, whereas in truth it is the greatest obstacle to salva- \
tion. You think that you can't get there from where and who \
you are at this moment because you are not yet complete or \
good enough, but the truth is that here and now is the only \
point from where you can get there. You "get" there by real- \
izing that you are there already. You find God the moment \
you realize that you don't need to seek God. So there is no \
only way to salvation: Any condition can be used, but no par- \
ticular condition is needed. However, there is only one point \
of access: the Now. There can be no salvation away from this \
moment. You are lonely and without a partner? Enter the \
Now from there. You are in a relationship? Enter the Now \
from there. \
\
There is nothing you can ever do or attain that will get you \
closer to salvation than it is at this moment. This may be \
hard to grasp for a mind accustomed to thinking that every- \
thing worthwhile is in the future. Nor can anything that you \
ever did or that was done to you in the past prevent you from \
saying yes to what is and taking your attention deeply into \
the Now. You cannot do this in the future. You do it now or \
not at all. \
\
\
\
LOVE/HATE RELATIONSHIPS \
\
Unless and until you access the consciousness frequency of \
presence, all relationships, and particularly intimate relation- \
ships, are deeply flawed and ultimately dysfunctional. They \
\
\
\
147 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
may seem perfect for a while, such as when you are "in love," \
but invariably that apparent perfection gets disrupted as \
arguments, conflicts, dissatisfaction, and emotional or even \
physical violence occur with increasing frequency. It seems \
that most "love relationships" become love/hate relation- \
ships before long. Love can then turn into savage attack, feel- \
ings of hostility, or complete withdrawal of affection at the \
flick of a switch. This is considered normal. The relationship \
then oscillates for a while, a few months or a few years, \
between the polarities of "love" and hate, and it gives you as \
much pleasure as it gives you pain. It is not uncommon \
for couples to become addicted to those cycles. Their drama \
makes them feel alive. When a balance between the positive/ \
negative polarities is lost and the negative, destructive cycles \
occur with increasing frequency and intensity, which tends \
to happen sooner or later, then it will not be long before the \
relationship finally collapses. \
\
It may appear that if you could only eliminate the negative or \
destructive cycles, then all would be well and the relationship \
would flower beautifully \'97 but alas, this is not possible. The \
polarities are mutually interdependent. You cannot have one \
without the other. The positive already contains within itself \
the as yet unmanifested negative. Both are in fact different \
aspects of the same dysfunction. I am speaking here of what \
are commonly called romantic relationships \'97 not of true \
love, which has no opposite because it arises from beyond \
the mind. Love as a continuous state is as yet very rare \'97 as \
rare as conscious human beings. Brief and elusive glimpses \
of love, however, are possible whenever there is a gap in the \
stream of mind. \
\
\
\
148 \
\
\
\
ENLIGHTENED RELATIONSHIPS \
\
The negative side of a relationship is, of course, more easily \
recognizable as dysfunctional than the positive one. And it is \
also easier to recognize the source of negativity in your part- \
ner than to see it in yourself. It can manifest in many forms: \
possessiveness, jealousy, control, withdrawal and unspoken \
resentment, the need to be right, insensitivity and self- \
absorption, emotional demands and manipulation, the urge \
to argue, criticize, judge, blame, or attack, anger, unconscious \
revenge for past pain inflicted by a parent, and rage and \
physical violence. \
\
On the positive side, you are "in love" with your partner. This \
is at first a deeply satisfying state. You feel intensely alive. \
Your existence has suddenly become meaningful because \
someone needs you, wants you, and makes you feel special, \
and you do the same for him or her. When you are together, \
you feel whole. The feeling can become so intense that the \
rest of the world fades into insignificance. \
\
However, you may also have noticed that there is a neediness \
and a clinging quality to that intensity. You become addicted \
to the other person. He or she acts on you like a drug. You are \
on a high when the drug is available, but even the possibility \
or the thought that he or she might no longer be there for you \
can lead to jealousy, possessiveness, attempts at manipula- \
tion through emotional blackmail, blaming and accusing \'97 \
fear of loss. If the other person does leave you, this can give \
rise to the most intense hostility or the most profound grief \
and despair. In an instant, loving tenderness can turn into a \
savage attack or dreadful grief. Where is the love now? Can \
love change into its opposite in an instant? Was it love in the \
first place, or just an addictive grasping and clinging? \

THE POWER OF NOW \
\
ADDICTION AND THE SEARCH FOR WHOLENESS \
\
Why should we become addicted to another person? \
\
The reason why the romantic love relationship is such an in- \
tense and universally sought-after experience is that it seems \
to offer liberation from a deep-seated state of fear, need, lack, \
and incompleteness that is part of the human condition in its \
unredeemed and unenlightened state. There is a physical as \
well as a psychological dimension to this state. \
\
On the physical level, you are obviously not whole, nor will \
you ever be: You are either a man or a woman, which is to say, \
one-half of the whole. On this level, the longing for wholeness \
\'97 the return to oneness \'97 manifests as male-female attrac- \
tion, man 's need for a woman, woman's need for a man. It is \
an almost irresistible urge for union with the opposite energy \
polarity. The root of this physical urge is a spiritual one: the \
longing for an end to duality, a return to the state of whole- \
ness. Sexual union is the closest you can get to this state on \
the physical level. This is why it is the most deeply satisfying \
experience the physical realm can offer. But sexual union is \
no more than a fleeting glimpse of wholeness, an instant of \
bliss. As long as it is unconsciously sought as a means of sal- \
vation, you are seeking the end of duality on the level of form, \
where it cannot be found. You are given a tantalizing glimpse \
of heaven, but you are not allowed to dwell there, and find \
yourself again in a separate body. \
\
On the psychological level, the sense of lack and incomplete- \
ness is, if anything, even greater than on the physical level. \
As long as you are identified with the mind, you have an \
externally derived sense of self. That is to say, you get your \
\
\
\
150 \
\
\
\
ENLIGHTENED RELATIONSHIPS \
\
sense of who you are from things that ultimately have noth- \
ing to do with who you are: your social role, possessions, \
external appearance, successes and failures, belief systems, \
and so on. This false, mind-made self, the ego, feels vulner- \
able, insecure, and is always seeking new things to identify \
with to give it a feeling that it exists. But nothing is ever \
enough to give it lasting fulfillment. Its fear remains; its \
sense of lack and neediness remains. \
\
But then that special relationship comes along. It seems to \
be the answer to all the ego's problems and to meet all its \
needs. At least this is how it appears at first. All the other \
things that you derived your sense of self from before now \
become relatively insignificant. You now have a single focal \
point that replaces them all, that gives meaning to your life, \
and through which you define your identity: the person you \
are "in love" with. You are no longer a disconnected frag- \
ment in an uncaring universe, or so it seems. Your world \
now has a center: the loved one. The fact that the center is \
outside you and that, therefore, you still have an externally \
derived sense of self does not seem to matter at first. What \
matters is that the underlying feelings of incompleteness, of \
fear, lack, and unfumllment so characteristic of the egoic state \
are no longer there \'97 or are they? Have they dissolved, or do \
they continue to exist underneath the happy surface reality? \
\
If in your relationships you experience both "love" and the \
opposite of love \'97 attack, emotional violence, and so on \'97 \
then it is likely that you are confusing ego attachment and \
addictive clinging with love. You cannot love your partner one \
moment and attack him or her the next. True love has no \
opposite. If your "love" has an opposite, then it is not love but \
a strong ego-need for a more complete and deeper sense of \
\
\
\
151 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
self, a need that the other person temporarily meets. It is the \
ego's substitute for salvation, and for a short time it almost \
does feel like salvation. \
\
But there comes a point when your partner behaves in ways \
that fail to meet your needs, or rather those of your ego. The \
feelings of fear, pain, and lack that are an intrinsic part of \
egoic consciousness but had been covered up by the "love \
relationship" now resurface. Just as with every other addic- \
tion, you are on a high when the drug is available, but invari- \
ably there comes a time when the drug no longer works for \
you. When those painful feelings reappear, you feel them \
even more strongly than before, and what is more, you now \
perceive your partner as the cause of those feelings. This \
means that you project them outward and attack the other \
with all the savage violence that is part of your pain. This \
attack may awaken the partner 's own pain, and he or she may \
counter your attack. At this point, the ego is still uncon- \
sciously hoping that its attack or its attempts at manipulation \
will be sufficient punishment to induce your partner to \
change their behavior, so that it can use them again as a \
cover-up for your pain. \
\
Every addiction arises from an unconscious refusal to face \
and move through your own pain. Every addiction starts with \
pain and ends with pain. Whatever the substance you are \
addicted to \'97 alcohol, food, legal or illegal drugs, or a person \
\'97 you are using something or somebody to cover up your \
pain. That is why, after the initial euphoria has passed, there \
is so much unhappiness, so much pain in intimate relation- \
ships. They do not cause pain and unhappiness. They bring \
out the pain and unhappiness that is already in you. Every \
addiction does that. Every addiction reaches a point where it \
\
\
\
152 \
\
\
\
ENLIGHTENED RELATIONSHIPS \
\
does not work for you anymore, and then you feel the pain \
more intensely than ever. \
\
This is one reason why most people are always trying to \
escape from the present moment and are seeking some kind \
of salvation in the future. The first thing that they might \
encounter if they focused their attention on the Now is their \
own pain, and this is what they fear. If they only knew how \
easy it is to access in the Now the power of presence that dis- \
solves the past and its pain, the reality that dissolves the illu- \
sion. If they only knew how close they are to their own \
reality, how close to God. \
\
Avoidance of relationships in an attempt to avoid pain is not \
the answer either. The pain is there anyway. Three failed \
relationships in as many years are more likely to force you \
into awakening than three years on a desert island or shut \
away in your room. But if you could bring intense presence \
into your aloneness, that would work for you too. \
\
\
\
FROM ADDICTIVE TO ENLIGHTENED RELATIONSHIPS \
\
Can we change an addictive relationship into a true one? \
\
Yes. Being present and intensifying your presence by taking \
your attention ever more deeply into the Now: Whether you \
are living alone or with a partner, this remains the key. For \
love to flourish, the light of your presence needs to be strong \
enough so that you no longer get taken over by the thinker or \
\
\
\
153 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
the pain-body and mistake them for who you are. To know \
yourself as the Being underneath the thinker, the stillness \
underneath the mental noise, the love and joy underneath the \
pain, is freedom, salvation, enlightenment. To disidentify \
from the pain-body is to bring presence into the pain and thus \
transmute it. To disidentify from thinking is to be the silent \
watcher of your thoughts and behavior, especially the repeti- \
tive patterns of your mind and the roles played by the ego. \
\
If you stop investing it with "selfness," the mind loses its \
compulsive quality, which basically is the compulsion to \
judge, and so to resist what is, which creates conflict, \
drama, and new pain. In fact, the moment that judgment \
stops through acceptance of what is, you are free of the \
mind. You have made room for love, for joy, for peace. First \
you stop judging yourself; then you stop judging your part- \
ner. The greatest catalyst for change in a relationship is \
complete acceptance of your partner as he or she is, without \
needing to judge or change them in any way. That immedi- \
ately takes you beyond ego. All mind games and all addictive \
clinging are then over. There are no victims and no perpe- \
trators anymore, no accuser and accused. This is also the \
end of all codependency, of being drawn into somebody \
else's unconscious pattern and thereby enabling it to con- \
tinue. You will then either separate \'97 in love \'97 or move \
ever more deeply into the Now together \'97 into Being. Can \
it be that simple? Yes, it is that simple. \
\
Love is a state of Being. Your love is not outside; it is deep \
within you. You can never lose it, and it cannot leave you. It \
is not dependent on some other body, some external form. \
In the stillness of your presence, you can feel your own \
formless and timeless reality as the unmanifested life that \
\
\
\
154 \
\
\
\
ENLIGHTENED RELATIONSHIPS \
\
animates your physical form. You can then feel the same life \
deep within every other human and every other creature. \
You look beyond the veil of form and separation. This is the \
realization of oneness. This is love. \
\
What is God? The eternal One Life underneath all the forms \
of life. What is love? To feel the presence of that One Life \
deep within yourself and within all creatures. To be it. There- \
fore, all love is the love of God. \
\
\
\
Love is not selective, just as the light of the sun is not selec- \
tive. It does not make one person special. It is not exclusive. \
Exclusivity is not the love of God but the "love" of ego. How- \
ever, the intensity with which true love is felt can vary. There \
may be one person who reflects your love back to you more \
clearly and more intensely than others, and if that person \
feels the same toward you, it can be said that you are in a love \
relationship with him or her. The bond that connects you with \
that person is the same bond that connects you with the per- \
son sitting next to you on a bus, or with a bird, a tree, a flower. \
Only the degree of intensity with which it is felt differs. \
\
Even in an otherwise addictive relationship, there may be \
moments when something more real shines through, \
something beyond your mutual addictive needs. These are \
moments when both your and your partner 's mind briefly \
subside and the pain-body is temporarily in a dormant state. \
This may sometimes happen during physical intimacy, \
or when you are both witnessing the miracle of childbirth, \
\
\
\
155 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
or in the presence of death, or when one of you is seriously \
ill \'97 anything that renders the mind powerless. When this \
happens, your Being, which is usually buried underneath \
the mind, becomes revealed, and it is this that makes true \
communication possible. \
\
True communication is communion \'97 the realization of \
oneness, which is love. Usually, this is quickly lost again, \
unless you are able to stay present enough to keep out the \
mind and its old patterns. As soon as the mind and mind \
identification return, you are no longer yourself but a men- \
tal image of yourself, and you start playing games and roles \
again to get your ego needs met. You are a human mind again, \
pretending to be a human being, interacting with another \
mind, playing a drama called "love." \
\
Although brief glimpses are possible, love cannot nourish \
unless you are permanently free of mind identification and \
your presence is intense enough to have dissolved the pain- \
body \'97 or you can at least remain present as the watcher. \
The pain-body cannot then take you over and so become \
destructive of love. \
\
RELATIONSHIPS AS SPIRITUAL PRACTICE \
\
As the egoic mode of consciousness and all the social, polit- \
ical, and economic structures that it created enter the final \
stage of collapse, the relationships between men and women \
reflect the deep state of crisis in which humanity now finds \
itself. As humans have become increasingly identified with \
their mind, most relationships are not rooted in Being and \
so turn into a source of pain and become dominated by prob- \
lems and conflict. \
\
\
\
156 \
\
\
\
ENLIGHTENED RELATIONSHIPS \
\
Millions are now living alone or as single parents, unable to \
establish an intimate relationship or unwilling to repeat the \
insane drama of past relationships. Others go from one rela- \
tionship to another, from one pleasure-and-pain cycle to \
another, in search of the elusive goal of fulfillment through \
union with the opposite energy polarity. Still others compro- \
mise and continue to be together in a dysfunctional relation- \
ship in which negativity prevails, for the sake of the children \
or security, through force of habit, fear of being alone, or some \
other mutually "beneficial" arrangement, or even through the \
unconscious addiction to the excitement of emotional drama \
and pain. \
\
However, every crisis represents not only danger but also \
opportunity. If relationships energize and magnify egoic \
mind patterns and activate the pain-body, as they do at this \
time, why not accept this fact rather than try to escape from \
it? Why not cooperate with it instead of avoiding relationships \
or continuing to pursue the phantom of an ideal partner as an \
answer to your problems or a means of feeling fulfilled? The \
opportunity that is concealed within every crisis does not \
manifest until all the facts of any given situation are acknowl- \
edged and fully accepted. As long as you deny them, as long \
as you try to escape from them or wish that things were dif- \
ferent, the window of opportunity does not open up, and you \
remain trapped inside that situation, which will remain the \
same or deteriorate further. \
\
With the acknowledgment and acceptance of the facts also \
comes a degree of freedom from them. For example, when you \
know there is disharmony and you hold that "knowing," \
through your knowing a new factor has come in, and the \
disharmony cannot remain unchanged. When you know you \
\
\
\
157 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
are not at peace, your knowing creates a still space that sur- \
rounds your nonpeace in a loving and tender embrace and then \
transmutes your nonpeace into peace. As far as inner transfor- \
mation is concerned, there is nothing you can do about it. You \
cannot transform yourself, and you certainly cannot transform \
your partner or anybody else. All you can do is create a space for \
transformation to happen, for grace and love to enter. \
\
\
\
So whenever your relationship is not working, whenever it \
brings out the "madness" in you and in your partner, be \
glad. What was unconscious is being brought up to the light. \
It is an opportunity for salvation. Every moment, hold the \
knowing of that moment, particularly of your inner state. If \
there is anger, know that there is anger. If there is jealousy, \
defensiveness, the urge to argue, the need to be right, an \
inner child demanding love and attention, or emotional pain \
of any kind \'97 whatever it is, know the reality of that moment \
and hold the knowing. The relationship then becomes your \
sadhana, your spiritual practice. If you observe unconscious \
behavior in your partner, hold it in the loving embrace of \
your knowing so that you won't react. Unconsciousness and \
knowing cannot coexist for long \'97 even if the knowing is \
only in the other person and not in the one who is acting out \
the unconsciousness. The energy form that lies behind hos- \
tility and attack finds the presence of love absolutely intoler- \
able. If you react at all to your partner 's unconsciousness, \
you become unconscious yourself. But if you then remem- \
ber to know your reaction, nothing is lost. \
\
\
\
158 \
\
\
\
ENLIGHTENED RELATIONSHIPS \
\
Humanity is under great pressure to evolve because it is our \
only chance of survival as a race. This will affect every aspect \
of your life and close relationships in particular. Never \
before have relationships been as problematic and conflict \
ridden as they are now. As you may have noticed, they are \
not here to make you happy or fulfilled. If you continue to \
pursue the goal of salvation through a relationship, you will \
be disillusioned again and again. But if you accept that the \
relationship is here to make you conscious instead of happy, \
then the relationship will offer you salvation, and you will be \
aligning yourself with the higher consciousness that wants \
to be born into this world. For those who hold on to the old \
patterns, there will be increasing pain, violence, confusion, \
and madness. \
\
I suppose that it takes two to make a relationship into a spiri- \
tual practice, as you suggest. For example, my partner is still \
acting out his old patterns of jealousy and control. I have \
pointed this out many times, but he is unable to see it. \
\
How many people does it take to make your life into a spiri- \
tual practice? Never mind if your partner will not cooperate. \
Sanity \'97 consciousness \'97 can only come into this world \
through you. You do not need to wait for the world to \
become sane, or for somebody else to become conscious, \
before you can be enlightened. You may wait forever. Do not \
accuse each other of being unconscious. The moment you \
start to argue, you have identified with a mental position and \
are now defending not only that position but also your sense \
of self. The ego is in charge. You have become unconscious. \
At times, it may be appropriate to point out certain aspects of \
your partner's behavior. If you are very alert, very present, \
\
\
\
159 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
you can do so without ego involvement \'97 without blaming, \
accusing, or making the other wrong. \
\
When your partner behaves unconsciously, relinquish all \
judgment. Judgment is either to confuse someone's uncon- \
scious behavior with who they are or to project your own \
unconsciousness onto another person and mistake that for \
who they are. To relinquish judgment does not mean that you \
do not recognize dysfunction and unconsciousness when \
you see it. It means "being the knowing" rather than "being \
the reaction" and the judge. You will then either be totally \
free of reaction or you may react and still be the knowing, \
the space in which the reaction is watched and allowed to \
be. Instead of fighting the darkness, you bring in the light. \
Instead of reacting to delusion, you see the delusion yet at \
the same time look through it. Being the knowing creates a \
clear space of loving presence that allows all things and all \
people to be as they are. No greater catalyst for transforma- \
tion exists. If you practice this, your partner cannot stay with \
you and remain unconscious. \
\
If you both agree that the relationship will be your spiritual \
practice, so much the better. You can then express your \
thoughts and feelings to each other as soon as they occur, or \
as soon as a reaction comes up, so that you do not create a \
time gap in which an unexpressed or unacknowledged emo- \
tion or grievance can fester and grow. Learn to give expres- \
sion to what you feel without blaming. Learn to listen to your \
partner in an open, nondefensive way. Give your partner \
space for expressing himself or herself. Be present. Accus- \
ing, defending, attacking \'97 all those patterns that are \
designed to strengthen or protect the ego or to get its needs \
met will then become redundant. Giving space to others \'97 \
\
\
\
160 \
\
\
\
ENLIGHTENED RELATIONSHIPS \
\
and to yourself \'97 is vital. Love cannot flourish without it. \
When you have removed the two factors that are destructive \
to relationships \'97 when the pain-body has been transmuted \
and you are no longer identified with mind and mental posi- \
tions \'97 and if your partner has done the same, you will expe- \
rience the bliss of the flowering of relationship. Instead of \
mirroring to each other your pain and your unconscious- \
ness, instead of satisfying your mutual addictive ego needs, \
you will reflect back to each other the love that you feel deep \
within, the love that comes with the realization of your one- \
ness with all that is. This is the love that has no opposite. \
\
If your partner is still identified with the mind and the pain- \
body while you are already free, this will represent a major \
challenge \'97 not to you but to your partner. It is not easy to \
live with an enlightened person, or rather it is so easy that the \
ego finds it extremely threatening. Remember that the ego \
needs problems, conflict, and "enemies" to strengthen the \
sense of separateness on which its identity depends. The \
unenlightened partner's mind will be deeply frustrated \
because its fixed positions are not resisted, which means \
they will become shaky and weak, and there is even the "dan- \
ger" that they may collapse altogether, resulting in loss of \
self. The pain-body is demanding feedback and not getting it. \
The need for argument, drama, and conflict is not being \
met. But beware: Some people who are unresponsive, with- \
drawn, insensitive, or cut off from their feelings may think \
and try to convince others that they are enlightened, or at \
least that there is "nothing wrong" with them and everything \
wrong with their partner. Men tend to do that more than \
women. They may see their female partners as irrational or \
emotional. But if you can feel your emotions, you are not far \
from the radiant inner body just underneath. If you are \
\
\
\
161 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
mainly in your head, the distance is much greater, and you \
need to bring consciousness into the emotional body before \
you can reach the inner body. \
\
If there isn't an emanation of love and joy, complete presence \
and openness toward all beings, then it is not enlightenment. \
Another indicator is how a person behaves in difficult or chal- \
lenging situations or when things "go wrong." If your "enlight- \
enment" is egoic self-delusion, then life will soon give you a \
challenge that will bring out your unconsciousness in what- \
ever form \'97 as fear, anger, defensiveness, judgment, depres- \
sion, and so on. If you are in a relationship, many of your \
challenges will come through your partner. For example, a \
woman may be challenged by an unresponsive male partner \
who lives almost entirely in his head. She will be challenged by \
his inability to hear her, to give her attention and space to be, \
which is due to his lack of presence. The absence of love in the \
relationship, which is usually more keenly felt by a woman \
than a man, will trigger the woman 's pain-body, and through \
it she will attack her partner \'97 blame, criticize, make wrong, \
and so on. This in turn now becomes his challenge. To defend \
himself against her pain-body's attack, which he sees as totally \
unwarranted, he will become even more deeply entrenched in \
his mental positions as he justifies, defends himself, or coun- \
terattacks. Eventually, this may activate his own pain-body. \
When both partners have thus been taken over, a level of deep \
unconsciousness has been reached, of emotional violence, sav- \
age attack and counterattack. It will not subside until both \
pain-bodies have replenished themselves and then enter the \
dormant stage. Until the next time. \
\
This is only one of an endless number of possible scenarios. \
Many volumes have been written, and many more could be \
\
\
\
162 \
\
\
\
ENLIGHTENED RELATIONSHIPS \
\
written, about the ways in which unconsciousness is brought \
out in male-female relationships. But, as I said earlier, once \
you understand the root of the dysfunction, you do not need \
to explore its countless manifestations. \
\
Let 's briefly look again at the scenario I have just described. \
Every challenge that it contains is actually a disguised oppor- \
tunity for salvation. At every stage of the unfolding dysfunc- \
tional process, freedom from unconsciousness is possible. \
For example, the woman's hostility could become a signal \
for the man to come out of his mind-identified state, awaken \
into the Now, become present \'97 instead of becoming even \
more identified with his mind, even more unconscious. \
Instead of "being" the pain-body, the woman could be the \
knowing that watches the emotional pain in herself, thus \
accessing the power of the Now and initiating the transmu- \
tation of the pain. This would remove the compulsive and \
automatic outward projection of it. She could then express \
her feelings to her partner. There is no guarantee, of course, \
that he will listen, but it gives him a good chance to become \
present and certainly breaks the insane cycle of the involun- \
tary acting out of old mind patterns. If the woman misses \
that opportunity, the man could watch his own mental- \
emotional reaction to her pain, his own defensiveness, rather \
than being the reaction. He could then watch his own pain- \
body being triggered and thus bring consciousness into \
his emotions. In this way, a clear and still space of pure aware- \
ness would come into being \'97 the knowing, the silent wit- \
ness, the watcher. This awareness does not deny the pain and \
yet is beyond it. It allows the pain to be and yet transmutes \
it at the same time. It accepts everything and transforms \
everything. A door would have opened up for her through \
which she could easily join him in that space. \
\
\
\
163 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
If you are consistently or at least predominantly present in \
your relationship, this will be the greatest challenge for your \
partner. They will not be able to tolerate your presence for \
very long and stay unconscious. If they are ready, they will \
walk through the door that you opened for them and join you \
in that state. If they are not, you will separate like oil and \
water. The light is too painful for someone who wants to \
remain in darkness. \
\
WHY WOMEN ARE CLOSER TO ENLIGHTENMENT \
\
Are the obstacles to enlightenment the same for a man as for \
a woman? \
\
Yes, but the emphasis is different. Generally speaking, it is \
easier for a woman to feel and be in her body, so she is nat- \
urally closer to Being and potentially closer to enlightenment \
than a man. This is why many ancient cultures instinctively \
chose female figures or analogies to represent or describe \
the formless and transcendental reality. It was often seen as \
a womb that gives birth to everything in creation and sus- \
tains and nourishes it during its life as form. In the Tao Te \
Ching, one of the most ancient and profound books ever \
written, the Tao, which could be translated as Being, is \
described as "infinite, eternally present, the mother of the \
universe." Naturally, women are closer to it than men since \
they virtually "embody" the Unmanifested. What is more, all \
creatures and all things must eventually return to the \
Source. "All things vanish into the Tao. It alone endures." \
Since the Source is seen as female, this is represented as the \
light and dark sides of the archetypal feminine in psychology \
\
\
\
164 \
\
\
\
ENLIGHTENED RELATIONSHIPS \
\
and mythology. The Goddess or Divine Mother has two aspects: \
She gives life, and she takes life. \
\
When the mind took over and humans lost touch with the \
reality of their divine essence, they started to think of God as \
a male figure. Society became male-dominated, and the female \
was made subordinate to the male. \
\
I am not suggesting a return to earlier female representa- \
tions of the divine. Some people now use the term Goddess \
instead of God. They are redressing a balance between male \
and female that was lost a long time ago, and that is good. \
But it is still a representation and a concept, perhaps tem- \
porarily useful, just as a map or a signpost is temporarily \
useful, but more a hindrance than a help when you are ready \
to realize the reality beyond all concepts and images. What \
does remain true, however, is that the energy frequency of \
the mind appears to be essentially male. The mind resists, \
fights for control, uses, manipulates, attacks, tries to grasp \
and possess, and so on. This is why the traditional God is a \
patriarchal, controlling authority figure, an often angry man \
who you should live in fear of, as the Old Testament sug- \
gests. This God is a projection of the human mind. \
\
To go beyond the mind and reconnect with the deeper reality \
of Being, very different qualities are needed: surrender, non- \
judgment, an openness that allows life to be instead of resist- \
ing it, the capacity to hold all things in the loving embrace of \
your knowing. All these qualities are much more closely \
related to the female principle. Whereas mind-energy is hard \
and rigid, Being-energy is soft and yielding and yet infinitely \
more powerful than mind. The mind runs our civilization, \
whereas Being is in charge of all life on our planet and \
\
\

\
beyond. Being is the very Intelligence whose visible manifes- \
tation is the physical universe. Although women are poten- \
tially closer to it, men can also access it within themselves. \
\
At this time, the vast majority of men as well as women are \
still in the grip of the mind: identified with the thinker and \
the pain-body. This, of course, is what prevents enlighten- \
ment and the flowering of love. As a general rule, the major \
obstacle for men tends to be the thinking mind, and the \
major obstacle for women the pain-body, although in certain \
individual cases the opposite may be true, and in others the \
two factors may be equal. \
\
DISSOLVING THE COLLECTIVE FEMALE PAIN-BODY \
\
Why is the pain-body more of an obstacle for women? \
\
The pain-body usually has a collective as well as a personal \
aspect. The personal aspect is the accumulated residue of \
emotional pain suffered in one's own past. The collective one \
is the pain accumulated in the collective human psyche over \
thousands of years through disease, torture, war, murder, cru- \
elty, madness, and so on. Everyone's personal pain-body also \
partakes of this collective pain-body. There are different \
strands in the collective pain-body. For example, certain races \
or countries in which extreme forms of strife and violence \
occur have a heavier collective pain-body than others. Anyone \
with a strong pain-body and not enough consciousness to \
disidentify from it will not only continuously or periodically be \
forced to relive their emotional pain but may also easily \
become either the perpetrator or the victim of violence, \
depending on whether their pain-body is predominantly active \
or passive. On the other hand, they may also be potentially \
\
\
\
166 \
\
\
\
ENLIGHTENED RELATIONSHIPS \
\
closer to enlightenment. This potential isn't necessarily real- \
ized, of course, but if you are trapped in a nightmare you will \
probably be more strongly motivated to awaken than someone \
who is just caught in the ups and downs of an ordinary dream. \
\
Apart from her personal pain-body, every woman has her \
share in what could be described as the collective female \
pain-body \'97 unless she is fully conscious. This consists of \
accumulated pain suffered by women partly through male \
subjugation of the female, through slavery, exploitation, \
rape, childbirth, child loss, and so on, over thousands of \
years. The emotional or physical pain that for many women \
precedes and coincides with the menstrual flow is the pain- \
body in its collective aspect that awakens from its dormancy \
at that time, although it can be triggered at other times too. \
It restricts the free flow of life energy through the body, of \
which menstruation is a physical expression. Let's dwell on \
this for a moment and see how it can become an opportunity \
for enlightenment. \
\
Often a woman is "taken over" by the pain-body at that time. \
It has an extremely powerful energetic charge that can easily \
pull you into unconscious identification with it. You are then \
actively possessed by an energy field that occupies your inner \
space and pretends to be you \'97 but, of course, is not you at \
all. It speaks through you, acts through you, thinks through \
you. It will create negative situations in your life so that it can \
feed on the energy. It wants more pain, in whatever form. I \
have described this process already. It can be vicious and \
destructive. It is pure pain, past pain \'97 and it is not you. \
\
The number of women who are now approaching the fully \
conscious state already exceeds that of men and will be grow- \
ing even faster in the years to come. Men may catch up with \
\
\
\
167 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
them in the end, but for some considerable time there will \
be a gap between the consciousness of men and that of \
women. Women are regaining the function that is their \
birthright and, therefore, comes to them more naturally than \
it does to men: to be a bridge between the manifested world \
and the Unmanifested, between physicality and spirit. Your \
main task as a woman now is to transmute the pain-body so \
that it no longer comes between you and your true self, the \
essence of who you are. Of course, you also have to deal with \
the other obstacle to enlightenment, which is the thinking \
mind, but the intense presence you generate when dealing \
with the pain-body will also free you from identification with \
the mind. \
\
The first thing to remember is this: As long as you make an \
identity for yourself out of the pain, you cannot become free \
of it. As long as part of your sense of self is invested in your \
emotional pain, you will unconsciously resist or sabotage every \
attempt that you make to heal that pain. Why? Quite simply \
because you want to keep yourself intact, and the pain has \
become an essential part of you. This is an unconscious pro- \
cess, and the only way to overcome it is to make it conscious. \
\
To suddenly see that you are or have been attached to your \
pain can be quite a shocking realization. The moment you \
realize this, you have broken the attachment. The pain-body \
is an energy field, almost like an entity, that has become tem- \
porarily lodged in your inner space. It is life energy that has \
become trapped, energy that is no longer flowing. Of course, \
the pain-body is there because of certain things that hap- \
pened in the past. It is the living past in you, and if you iden- \
tify with it, you identify with the past. A victim identity is the \
belief that the past is more powerful than the present, which \
\
\
\
168 \
\
\
\
ENLIGHTENED RELATIONSHIPS \
\
is the opposite of the truth. It is the belief that other people \
and what they did to you are responsible for who you are \
now, for your emotional pain or your inability to be your true \
self. The truth is that the only power there is is contained \
within this moment: It is the power of your presence. Once \
you know that, you also realize that you are responsible for \
your inner space now \'97 nobody else is \'97 and that the past \
cannot prevail against the power of the Now. \
\
\
\
So identification prevents you from dealing with the pain- \
body. Some women who are already conscious enough to \
have relinquished their victim identity on the personal level \
are still holding on to a collective victim identity: "what men \
did to women." They are right \'97 and they are also wrong. \
They are right inasmuch as the collective female pain-body is \
in large part due to male violence inflicted on women and \
repression of the female principle throughout the planet \
over millennia. They are wrong if they derive a sense of self \
from this fact and thereby keep themselves imprisoned in \
a collective victim identity. If a woman is still holding on \
to anger, resentment, or condemnation, she is holding on to \
her pain-body. This may give her a comforting sense of iden- \
tity, of solidarity with other women, but it is keeping her in \
bondage to the past and blocking full access to her essence \
and true power. If women exclude themselves from men, \
that fosters a sense of separation and therefore a strengthen- \
ing of the ego. And the stronger the ego, the more distant \
you are from your true nature. \
\
\
\
169 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
So do not use the pain-body to give you an identity. Use it for \
enlightenment instead. Transmute it into consciousness. \
One of the best times for this is during menses. I believe \
that, in the years to come, many women will enter the fully \
conscious state during that time. Usually, it is a time of \
unconsciousness for many women, as they are taken over by \
the collective female pain-body. Once you have reached a cer- \
tain level of consciousness, however, you can reverse this, so \
instead of becoming unconscious you become more con- \
scious. I have described the basic process already, but let me \
take you through it again, this time with special reference to \
the collective female pain-body. \
\
When you know that the menstrual flow is approaching, \
before you feel the first signs of what is commonly called \
premenstrual tension, the awakening of the collective female \
pain-body, become very alert and inhabit your body as fully \
as possible. When the first sign appears, you need to be alert \
enough to "catch" it before it takes you over. For example, \
the first sign may be a sudden, strong irritation or a flash of \
anger, or it may be a purely physical symptom. Whatever it \
is, catch it before it can take over your thinking or behavior. \
This simply means putting the spotlight of your attention on \
it. If it is an emotion, feel the strong energy charge behind it. \
Know that it is the pain-body. At the same time, be the know- \
ing; that is to say, be aware of your conscious presence and \
feel its power. Any emotion that you take your presence into \
will quickly subside and become transmuted. If it is a purely \
physical symptom, the attention that you give it will prevent \
it from turning into an emotion or a thought. Then continue \
to be alert and wait for the next sign of the pain-body. When \
it appears, catch it again in the same way as before. \
\
\
\
170 \
\
\
\
ENLIGHTENED RELATIONSHIPS \
\
Later, when the pain-body has fully awakened from its dor- \
mant state, you may experience considerable turbulence in \
your inner space for a while, perhaps for several days. What- \
ever form this takes, stay present. Give it your complete \
attention. Watch the turbulence inside you. Know it is there. \
Hold the knowing, and be the knowing. Remember: Do not \
let the pain-body use your mind and take over your thinking. \
Watch it. Feel its energy directly, inside your body. As you \
know, full attention means full acceptance. \
\
Through sustained attention and thus acceptance, there \
comes transmutation. The pain-body becomes transformed \
into radiant consciousness, just as a piece of wood, when \
placed in or near a fire, itself is transformed into fire. Men- \
struation will then become not only a joyful and fulfilling \
expression of your womanhood but also a sacred time of \
transmutation, when you give birth to a new consciousness. \
Your true nature then shines forth, both in its female aspect \
as the Goddess and in its transcendental aspect as the divine \
Being that you are beyond male and female duality. \
\
If your male partner is conscious enough, he can help you \
with the practice I have just described by holding the fre- \
quency of intense presence particularly at this time. If he \
stays present whenever you fall back into unconscious iden- \
tification with the pain-body, which can and will happen at \
first, you will be able to quickly rejoin him in that state. This \
means that whenever the pain-body temporarily takes over, \
whether during menses or at other times, your partner will \
not mistake it for who you are. Even if the pain-body attacks \
him, as it probably will, he will not react to it as if it were \
"you," withdraw, or put up some kind of defense. He will \
hold the space of intense presence. Nothing else is needed \
\
\
\
171 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
for transformation. At other times, you will be able to do the \
same for him or help him reclaim consciousness from \
the mind by drawing his attention into the here and now \
whenever he becomes identified with his thinking. \
\
In this way, a permanent energy field of a pure and high fre- \
quency will arise between you. No illusion, no pain, no con- \
flict, nothing that is not you, and nothing that is not love can \
survive in it. This represents the fulfillment of the divine, \
transpersonal purpose of your relationship. It becomes a vor- \
tex of consciousness that will draw in many others. \
\
\
\
GIVE UP THE RELATIONSHIP WITH YOURSELF \
\
When one is fully conscious, would one still have a need for a \
relationship? Would a man still feel drawn to a woman? \
Would a woman still feel incomplete without a man? \
\
Enlightened or not, you are either a man or a woman, so on \
the level of your form identity you are not complete. You \
are one-half of the whole. This incompleteness is felt as \
male-female attraction, the pull toward the opposite energy \
polarity, no matter how conscious you are. But in that state \
of inner connectedness, you feel this pull somewhere on \
the surface or periphery of your life. Anything that happens \
to you in that state feels somewhat like that. The whole \
world seems like waves or ripples on the surface of a vast and \
deep ocean. You are that ocean and, of course, you are also a \
ripple, but a ripple that has realized its true identity as the \
\
\
\
172 \
\
\
\
ENLIGHTENED RELATIONSHIPS \
\
ocean, and compared to that vastness and depth, the world of \
waves and ripples is not all that important. \
\
This does not mean that you don't relate deeply to other \
people or to your partner. In fact, you can relate deeply only \
if you are conscious of Being. Coming from Being, you are \
able to focus beyond the veil of form. In Being, male and \
female are one. Your form may continue to have certain \
needs, but Being has none. It is already complete and whole. \
If those needs are met, that is beautiful, but whether or not \
they are met makes no difference to your deep inner state. So \
it is perfectly possible for an enlightened person, if the need \
for the male or female polarity is not met, to feel a sense of \
lack or incompleteness on the outer level of his or her being, \
yet at the same time be totally complete, fulfilled, and at \
peace within. \
\
In the quest for enlightenment, is being gay a help or a hin- \
drance, or does it not make any difference? \
\
As you approach adulthood, uncertainty about your sexuality \
followed by the realization that you are "different" from oth- \
ers may force you to disidentify from socially conditioned \
patterns of thought and behavior. This will automatically \
raise your level of consciousness above that of the uncon- \
scious majority, whose members unquestioningly take on \
board all inherited patterns. In that respect, being gay can be \
a help. Being an outsider to some extent, someone who does \
not "fit in" with others or is rejected by them for whatever \
reason, makes life difficult, but it also places you at an advan- \
tage as far as enlightenment is concerned. It takes you out of \
unconsciousness almost by force. \
\
\
\
173 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
On the other hand, if you then develop a sense of identity \
based on your gayness, you have escaped one trap only to fall \
into another. You will play roles and games dictated by a \
mental image you have of yourself as gay. You will become \
unconscious. You will become unreal. Underneath your ego \
mask, you will become very unhappy. If this happens to you, \
being gay will have become a hindrance. But you always get \
another chance, of course. Acute unhappiness can be a great \
awakener. \
\
Is it not true that you need to have a good relationship with \
yourself and love yourself before you can have a fulfilling rela- \
tionship with another person? \
\
If you cannot be at ease with yourself when you are alone, \
you will seek a relationship to cover up your unease. You can \
be sure that the unease will then reappear in some other \
form within the relationship, and you will probably hold \
your partner responsible for it. \
\
All you really need to do is accept this moment fully. You are \
then at ease in the here and now and at ease with yourself. \
\
But do you need to have a relationship with yourself at all? \
Why can't you just be yourself? When you have a relation- \
ship with yourself, you have split yourself into two: "I" and \
"myself," subject and object. That mind-created duality is the \
root cause of all unnecessary complexity, of all problems and \
conflict in your life. In the state of enlightenment, you are \
yourself \'97 "you" and "yourself merge into one. You do not \
judge yourself, you do not feel sorry for yourself, you are \
not proud of yourself, you do not love yourself, you do not \
\
\
\
174 \
\
\
\
ENLIGHTENED RELATIONSHIPS \
\
hate yourself, and so on. The split caused by self-reflective \
consciousness is healed, its curse removed. There is no \
"self that you need to protect, defend, or feed anymore. \
When you are enlightened, there is one relationship that you \
no longer have: the relationship with yourself. Once you have \
given that up, all your other relationships will be love rela- \
tionships. \

CHAPTER NINE \
\
\
\
BEYOND HAPPINESS \
\
AND UNHAPPINESS \
\
THERE IS PEACE \
\
\
\
THE HIGHER GOOD BEYOND GOOD AND BAD \
\
Is there a difference between happiness and inner peace? \
\
Yes. Happiness depends on conditions being perceived as \
positive; inner peace does not. \
\
Is it not possible to attract only positive conditions into our life? \
If our attitude and our thinking are always positive, we would \
manifest only positive events and situations, wouldn't we? \
\
Do you truly know what is positive and what is negative? Do \
you have the total picture? There have been many people for \
whom limitation, failure, loss, illness, or pain in whatever \
form turned out to be their greatest teacher. It taught them \
to let go of false self-images and superficial ego-dictated \
goals and desires. It gave them depth, humility, and compas- \
sion. It made them more real. \
\
Whenever anything negative happens to you, there is a deep \
lesson concealed within it, although you may not see it at the \
\
\
\
177 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
time. Even a brief illness or an accident can show you what \
is real and unreal in your life, what ultimately matters and \
what doesn't. \
\
Seen from a higher perspective, conditions are always posi- \
tive. To be more precise: they are neither positive nor neg- \
ative. They are as they are. And when you live in complete \
acceptance of what is \'97 which is the only sane way to live \'97 \
there is no "good" or "bad" in your life anymore. There is \
only a higher good \'97 which includes the "bad." Seen from \
the perspective of the mind, however, there is good-bad, like- \
dislike, love-hate. Hence, in the Book of Genesis, it is said \
that Adam and Eve were no longer allowed to dwell in "par- \
adise" when they "ate of the tree of the knowledge of good \
and evil." \
\
This sounds to me like denial and self-deception. When some- \
thing dreadful happens to me or someone close to me \'97 acci- \
dent, illness, pain of some kind, or death \'97 I can pretend that \
it isn't bad, but the fact remains that it is bad, so why deny it? \
\
You are not pretending anything. You are allowing it to be as \
it is, that's all. This "allowing to be" takes you beyond the \
mind with its resistance patterns that create the positive- \
negative polarities. It is an essential aspect of forgiveness. \
Forgiveness of the present is even more important than for- \
giveness of the past. If you forgive every moment \'97 allow it \
to be as it is \'97 then there will be no accumulation of resent- \
ment that needs to be forgiven at some later time. \
\
Remember that we are not talking about happiness here. For \
example, when a loved one has just died, or you feel your own \
death approaching, you cannot be happy. It is impossible. But \
\
\
\
178 \
\
\
\
BEYOND HAPPINESS AND UNHAPPINESS THERE IS PEACE \
\
you can be at peace. There may be sadness and tears, but \
provided that you have relinquished resistance, underneath \
the sadness you will feel a deep serenity, a stillness, a sacred \
presence. This is the emanation of Being, this is inner peace, \
the good that has no opposite. \
\
What if it is a situation that I can do something about? How \
can I allow it to be and change it at the same time? \
\
Do what you have to do. In the meantime, accept what is. \
Since mind and resistance are synonymous, acceptance \
immediately frees you from mind dominance and thus \
reconnects you with Being. As a result, the usual ego moti- \
vations for "doing" \'97 fear, greed, control, defending or feed- \
ing the false sense of self \'97 will cease to operate. An \
intelligence much greater than the mind is now in charge, \
and so a different quality of consciousness will flow into your \
doing. \
\
"Accept whatever comes to you woven in the pattern of your \
destiny, for what could more aptly fit your needs?" This was \
written two thousand years ago by Marcus Aurelius, one of \
those exceedingly rare humans who possessed worldly \
power as well as wisdom. \
\
It seems that most people need to experience a great deal of \
suffering before they will relinquish resistance and accept \'97 \
before they will forgive. As soon as they do, one of the great- \
est miracles happens: the awakening of Being-consciousness \
through what appears as evil, the transmutation of suffering \
into inner peace. The ultimate effect of all the evil and suf- \
fering in the world is that it will force humans into realizing \
who they are beyond name and form. Thus, what we perceive \
\
\
\
179 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
as evil from our limited perspective is actually part of the \
higher good that has no opposite. This, however, does \
not become true for you except through forgiveness. Until \
that happens, evil has not been redeemed and therefore \
remains evil. \
\
Through forgiveness, which essentially means recognizing \
the insubstantiality of the past and allowing the present \
moment to be as it is, the miracle of transformation happens \
not only within but also without. A silent space of intense \
presence arises both in you and around you. Whoever or \
whatever enters that field of consciousness will be affected \
by it, sometimes visibly and immediately, sometimes at \
deeper levels with visible changes appearing at a later time. \
You dissolve discord, heal pain, dispel unconsciousness \'97 \
without doing anything \'97 simply by being and holding that \
frequency of intense presence. \
\
\
\
THE END OF YOUR LIFE DRAMA \
\
In that state of acceptance and inner peace, even though you \
may not call it "bad, " can anything still come into your life \
that would be called "bad" from a perspective of ordinary con- \
sciousness? \
\
Most of the so-called bad things that happen in people's lives \
are due to unconsciousness. They are self-created, or rather \
ego-created. I sometimes refer to those things as "drama." \
When you are fully conscious, drama does not come into \
\
\
\
180 \
\
\
\
BEYOND HAPPINESS AND UNHAPPINESS THERE IS PEACE \
\
your life anymore. Let me remind you briefly how the ego \
operates and how it creates drama. \
\
Ego is the unobserved mind that runs your life when you are \
not present as the witnessing consciousness, the watcher. The \
ego perceives itself as a separate fragment in a hostile uni- \
verse, with no real inner connection to any other being, sur- \
rounded by other egos which it either sees as a potential threat \
or which it will attempt to use for its own ends. The basic ego \
patterns are designed to combat its own deep-seated fear and \
sense of lack. They are resistance, control, power, greed, \
defense, attack. Some of the ego's strategies are extremely \
clever, yet they never truly solve any of its problems, simply \
because the ego itself is the problem. \
\
When egos come together, whether in personal relationships or \
in organizations or institutions, "bad" things happen sooner \
or later: drama of one kind or another, in the form of con- \
flict, problems, power struggles, emotional or physical vio- \
lence, and so on. This includes collective evils such as war, \
genocide, and exploitation \'97 all due to massed unconscious- \
ness. Furthermore, many types of illness are caused by the \
ego's continuous resistance, which creates restrictions and \
blockages in the flow of energy through the body. When you \
reconnect with Being and are no longer run by your mind, \
you cease to create those things. You do not create or partici- \
pate in drama anymore. \
\
Whenever two or more egos come together, drama of one \
kind or another ensues. But even if you live totally alone, you \
still create your own drama. When you feel sorry for yourself, \
that's drama. When you feel guilty or anxious, that's drama. \
When you let the past or future obscure the present, you are \
creating time, psychological time \'97 the stuff out of which \
\
\
\
181 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
drama is made. Whenever you are not honoring the present \
moment by allowing it to be, you are creating drama. \
\
Most people are in love with their particular life drama. Their \
story is their identity. The ego runs their life. They have their \
whole sense of self invested in it. Even their \'97 usually \
unsuccessful \'97 search for an answer, a solution, or for heal- \
ing becomes part of it. What they fear and resist most is the \
end of their drama. As long as they are their mind, what they \
fear and resist most is their own awakening. \
\
When you live in complete acceptance of what is, that is the \
end of all drama in your life. Nobody can even have an argu- \
ment with you, no matter how hard he or she tries. You can- \
not have an argument with a fully conscious person. An \
argument implies identification with your mind and a men- \
tal position, as well as resistance and reaction to the other \
person's position. The result is that the polar opposites \
become mutually energized. These are the mechanics of \
unconsciousness. You can still make your point clearly and \
firmly, but there will be no reactive force behind it, no \
defense or attack. So it won't turn into drama. When you are \
fully conscious, you cease to be in conflict. "No one who is \
at one with himself can even conceive of conflict," states \
A Course in Miracles. This refers not only to conflict with \
other people but more fundamentally to conflict within you, \
which ceases when there is no longer any clash between the \
demands and expectations of your mind and what is. \
\
IMPERMANENCE AND THE CYCLES OF LIFE \
\
However, as long as you are in the physical dimension and \
linked to the collective human psyche, physical pain \'97 \
\
\
\
182 \
\
\
\
BEYOND HAPPINESS AND UNHAPPINESS THERE IS PEACE \
\
although rare \'97 is still possible. This is not to be confused \
with suffering, with mental-emotional pain. All suffering is \
ego-created and is due to resistance. Also, as long as you are \
in this dimension, you are still subject to its cyclical nature \
and to the law of impermanence of all things, but you no \
longer perceive this as "bad" \'97 it just is. \
\
Through allowing the "isness" of all things, a deeper dimension \
underneath the play of opposites reveals itself to you as an abid- \
ing presence, an unchanging deep stillness, an uncaused joy \
beyond good and bad. This is the joy of Being, the peace of God. \
\
On the level of form, there is birth and death, creation and \
destruction, growth and dissolution, of seemingly separate \
forms. This is reflected everywhere: in the life cycle of a star \
or a planet, a physical body, a tree, a flower; in the rise and \
fall of nations, political systems, civilizations; and in the \
inevitable cycles of gain and loss in the life of an individual. \
\
There are cycles of success, when things come to you and \
thrive, and cycles of failure, when they wither or disintegrate \
and you have to let them go in order to make room for new \
things to arise, or for transformation to happen. If you cling \
and resist at that point, it means you are refusing to go with \
the flow of life, and you will suffer. \
\
It is not true that the up cycle is good and the down cycle bad, \
except in the mind's judgment. Growth is usually considered \
positive, but nothing can grow forever. If growth, of what- \
ever kind, were to go on and on, it would eventually become \
monstrous and destructive. Dissolution is needed for new \
growth to happen. One cannot exist without the other. \
\
The down cycle is absolutely essential for spiritual realization. \
You must have failed deeply on some level or experienced \
\
\
\
183 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
some deep loss or pain to be drawn to the spiritual dimen- \
sion. Or perhaps your very success became empty and mean- \
ingless and so turned out to be failure. Failure lies concealed \
in every success, and success in every failure. In this world, \
which is to say on the level of form, everybody "fails" sooner \
or later, of course, and every achievement eventually comes \
to naught. All forms are impermanent. \
\
You can still be active and enjoy manifesting and creating \
new forms and circumstances, but you won't be identified \
with them. You do not need them to give you a sense of self. \
They are not your life \'97 only your life situation. \
\
Your physical energy is also subject to cycles. It cannot always \
be at a peak. There will be times of low as well as high energy. \
There will be periods when you are highly active and creative, \
but there may also be times when everything seems stagnant, \
when it seems that you are not getting anywhere, not achiev- \
ing anything. A cycle can last for anything from a few hours \
to a few years. There are large cycles and small cycles within \
these large ones. Many illnesses are created through fighting \
against the cycles of low energy, which are vital for regenera- \
tion. The compulsion to do, and the tendency to derive your \
sense of self-worth and identity from external factors such as \
achievement, is an inevitable illusion as long as you are iden- \
tified with the mind. This makes it hard or impossible for you \
to accept the low cycles and allow them to be. Thus, the intel- \
ligence of the organism may take over as a self-protective \
measure and create an illness in order to force you to stop, so \
that the necessary regeneration can take place. \
\
The cyclical nature of the universe is closely linked with the \
impermanence of all things and situations. The Buddha \
made this a central part of his teaching. All conditions are \
\
\
\
184 \
\
\
\
BEYOND HAPPINESS AND UNHAPPINESS THERE IS PEACE \
\
highly unstable and in constant flux, or, as he put it, imper- \
manence is a characteristic of every condition, every situa- \
tion you will ever encounter in your life. It will change, \
disappear, or no longer satisfy you. Impermanence is also \
central to Jesus's teaching: "Do not lay up for yourselves \
treasures on earth, where moth and rust consume and where \
thieves break in and steal " \
\
As long as a condition is judged as "good" by your mind, \
whether it be a relationship, a possession, a social role, a \
place, or your physical body, the mind attaches itself to it and \
identifies with it. It makes you happy, makes you feel good \
about yourself, and it may become part of who you are or \
think you are. But nothing lasts in this dimension where \
moth and rust consume. Either it ends or it changes, or it \
may undergo a polarity shift: The same condition that was \
good yesterday or last year has suddenly or gradually turned \
into bad. The same condition that made you happy then \
makes you unhappy. The prosperity of today becomes the \
empty consumerism of tomorrow. The happy wedding and \
honeymoon become the unhappy divorce or the unhappy \
coexistence. Or a condition disappears, so its absence makes \
you unhappy. When a condition or situation that the mind \
has attached itself to and identified with changes or disap- \
pears, the mind cannot accept it. It will cling to the disappear- \
ing condition and resist the change. It is almost as if a limb \
were being torn off your body. \
\
We sometimes hear of people who have lost all their money \
or whose reputations have been ruined committing suicide. \
Those are the extreme cases. Others, whenever a major loss \
of one kind or another occurs, just become deeply unhappy \
or make themselves ill. They cannot distinguish between \
\
\
\
185 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
their life and their life situation. I recently read about a \
famous actress who died in her eighties. As her beauty \
started to fade and became ravaged by old age, she grew des- \
perately unhappy and became a recluse. She, too, had identi- \
fied with a condition: her external appearance. First, the \
condition gave her a happy sense of self, then an unhappy \
one. If she had been able to connect with the formless and \
timeless life within, she could have watched and allowed the \
fading of her external form from a place of serenity and \
peace. Moreover, her external form would have become \
increasingly transparent to the light shining through from \
her ageless true nature, so her beauty would not really have \
faded but simply become transformed into spiritual beauty. \
However, nobody told her that this is possible. The most \
essential kind of knowledge is not yet widely accessible. \
\
\
\
The Buddha taught that even your happiness is dukkha \'97 a \
Pali word meaning "suffering" or "unsatisfactoriness." It is \
inseparable from its opposite. This means that your happi- \
ness and unhappiness are in fact one. Only the illusion of \
time separates them. \
\
This is not being negative. It is simply recognizing the nature \
of things, so that you don't pursue an illusion for the rest of \
your life. Nor is it saying that you should no longer appre- \
ciate pleasant or beautiful things or conditions. But to seek \
something through them that they cannot give \'97 an identity, \
a sense of permanency and fulfillment \'97 is a recipe for frus- \
tration and suffering. The whole advertising industry and \
\
\
\
186 \
\
\
\
BEYOND HAPPINESS AND UNHAPPINESS THERE IS PEACE \
\
consumer society would collapse if people became enlight- \
ened and no longer sought to find their identity through \
things. The more you seek happiness in this way, the more it \
will elude you. Nothing out there will ever satisfy you except \
temporarily and superficially, but you may need to experience \
many disillusionments before you realize that truth. Things \
and conditions can give you pleasure, but they will also give \
you pain. Things and conditions can give you pleasure, but \
they cannot give you joy. Nothing can give you joy. Joy is \
uncaused and arises from within as the joy of Being. It is an \
essential part of the inner state of peace, the state that has \
been called the peace of God. It is your natural state, not \
something that you need to work hard for or struggle to \
attain. \
\
Many people never realize that there can be no "salvation" in \
anything they do, possess, or attain. Those who do realize it \
often become world-weary and depressed: If nothing can \
give you true fulfillment, what is there left to strive for, what \
is the point in anything? The Old Testament prophet must \
have arrived at such a realization when he wrote: "I have \
seen everything that is done under the sun, and behold, all is \
vanity and a striving after wind." When you reach this point, \
you are one step away from despair \'97 and one step away \
from enlightenment. \
\
A Buddhist monk once told me: "All I have learned in the \
twenty years that I have been a monk I can sum up in one \
sentence: All that arises passes away. This I know." What he \
meant, of course, was this: I have learned to offer no resis- \
tance to what is; I have learned to allow the present moment \
to be and to accept the impermanent nature of all things and \
conditions. Thus have I found peace. \
\
\
\
187 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
To offer no resistance to life is to be in a state of grace, ease, and \
lightness. This state is then no longer dependent upon things \
being in a certain way, good or bad. It seems almost paradoxi- \
cal, yet when your inner dependency on form is gone, the gen- \
eral conditions of your life, the outer forms, tend to improve \
greatly. Things, people, or conditions that you thought you \
needed for your happiness now come to you with no struggle \
or effort on your part, and you are free to enjoy and appreciate \
them \'97 while they last. All those things, of course, will still \
pass away, cycles will come and go, but with dependency gone \
there is no fear of loss anymore, life flows with ease. \
\
The happiness that is derived from some secondary source \
is never very deep. It is only a pale reflection of the joy of \
Being, the vibrant peace that you find within as you enter the \
state of nonresistance. Being takes you beyond the polar \
opposites of the mind and frees you from dependency on \
form. Even if everything were to collapse and crumble all \
around you, you would still feel a deep inner core of peace. \
You may not be happy, but you will be at peace. \
\
\
\
USING AND RELINQUISHING NEGATIVITY \
\
All inner resistance is experienced as negativity in one form \
or another. All negativity is resistance. In this context, the \
two words are almost synonymous. Negativity ranges from \
irritation or impatience to fierce anger, from a depressed \
mood or sullen resentment to suicidal despair. Sometimes \
the resistance triggers the emotional pain-body, in which \
\
\
\
188 \
\
\
\
BEYOND HAPPINESS AND UNHAPPINESS THERE IS PEACE \
\
case even a minor situation may produce intense negativity, \
such as anger, depression, or deep grief. \
\
The ego believes that through negativity it can manipulate \
reality and get what it wants. It believes that through it, it can \
attract a desirable condition or dissolve an undesirable one. \
A Course in Miracles rightly points out that, whenever you \
are unhappy, there is the unconscious belief that the unhap- \
piness "buys" you what you want. If "you" \'97 the mind \'97 \
did not believe that unhappiness works, why would you cre- \
ate it? The fact is, of course, that negativity does not work. \
Instead of attracting a desirable condition, it stops it from \
arising. Instead of dissolving an undesirable one, it keeps it \
in place. Its only "useful" function is that it strengthens the \
ego, and that is why the ego loves it. \
\
Once you have identified with some form of negativity, you \
do not want to let go, and on a deeply unconscious level, you do \
not want positive change. It would threaten your identity as \
a depressed, angry, or hard-done-by person. You will then \
ignore, deny, or sabotage the positive in your life. This is a \
common phenomenon. It is also insane. \
\
Negativity is totally unnatural. It is a psychic pollutant, and \
there is a deep link between the poisoning and destruction of \
nature and the vast negativity that has accumulated in the \
collective human psyche. No other life-form on the planet \
knows negativity, only humans, just as no other life-form \
violates and poisons the Earth that sustains it. Have you ever \
seen an unhappy flower or a stressed oak tree? Have you \
come across a depressed dolphin, a frog that has a problem \
with self-esteem, a cat that cannot relax, or a bird that carries \
hatred and resentment? The only animals that may occasion- \
ally experience something akin to negativity or show signs of \
\
\
\
189 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
neurotic behavior are those that live in close contact with \
humans and so link into the human mind and its insanity. \
\
Watch any plant or animal and let it teach you acceptance of \
what is, surrender to the Now. Let it teach you Being. Let it \
teach you integrity \'97 which means to be one, to be yourself, \
to be real. Let it teach you how to live and how to die, and \
how not to make living and dying into a problem. \
\
I have lived with several Zen masters \'97 all of them cats. \
Even ducks have taught me important spiritual lessons. Just \
watching them is a meditation. How peacefully they float \
along, at ease with themselves, totally present in the Now, \
dignified and perfect as only a mindless creature can be. \
Occasionally, however, two ducks will get into a fight \'97 \
sometimes for no apparent reason, or because one duck has \
strayed into another's private space. The fight usually lasts \
only for a few seconds, and then the ducks separate, swim off \
in opposite directions, and vigorously flap their wings a few \
times. They then continue to swim on peacefully as if the \
fight had never happened. When I observed that for the first \
time, I suddenly realized that by flapping their wings they \
were releasing surplus energy, thus preventing it from \
becoming trapped in their body and turning into negativity. \
This is natural wisdom, and it is easy for them because they \
do not have a mind that keeps the past alive unnecessarily \
and then builds an identity around it. \
\
Couldn't a negative emotion also contain an important mes- \
sage? For example, if I often feel depressed, it may be a signal \
that there is something wrong with my life, and it may force \
me to look at my life situation and make some changes. So I \
need to listen to what the emotion is telling me and not just \
dismiss it as negative. \
\
\
\
190 \
\
\
\
BEYOND HAPPINESS AND U N H A P P I N E S S T H E R E IS PEACE \
\
Yes, recurring negative emotions do sometimes contain a \
message, as do illnesses. But any changes that you make, \
whether they have to do with your work, your relationships, \
or your surroundings, are ultimately only cosmetic unless \
they arise out of a change in your level of consciousness. And \
as far as that is concerned, it can only mean one thing: \
becoming more present. When you have reached a certain \
degree of presence, you don't need negativity anymore to tell \
you what is needed in your life situation. But as long as neg- \
ativity is there, use it. Use it as a kind of signal that reminds \
you to be more present. \
\
How do we stop negativity from arising, and how do we get rid \
of it once it is there? \
\
As I said, you stop it from arising by being fully present. But \
don't become discouraged. There are as yet few people on \
the planet who can sustain a state of continuous presence, al- \
though some are getting close to it. Soon, I believe, there will \
be many more. \
\
Whenever you notice that some form of negativity has \
arisen within you, look on it not as a failure, but as a help- \
ful signal that is telling you: "Wake up. Get out of your \
mind. Be present." \
\
There is a novel by Aldous Huxley called Island, written in \
his later years when he became very interested in spiritual \
teachings. It tells the story of a man shipwrecked on a \
remote island cut off from the rest of the world. This island \
contains a unique civilization. The unusual thing about it \
is that its inhabitants, unlike those of the rest of the world, \
are actually sane. The first thing that the man notices are the \
\
\
\
191 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
colorful parrots perched in the trees, and they seem to be \
constantly croaking the words "Attention. Here and Now. \
Attention. Here and Now." We later learn that the islanders \
taught them these words in order to be reminded continu- \
ously to stay present. \
\
So whenever you feel negativity arising within you, whether \
caused by an external factor, a thought, or even nothing in \
particular that you are aware of, look on it as a voice saying \
"Attention. Here and Now. Wake up." Even the slightest \
irritation is significant and needs to be acknowledged and \
looked at; otherwise, there will be a cumulative buildup of \
unobserved reactions. As I said before, you may be able to \
just drop it once you realize that you don't want to have this \
energy field inside you and that it serves no purpose. But \
then make sure that you drop it completely. If you cannot \
drop it, just accept that it is there and take your attention into \
the feeling, as I pointed out earlier. \
\
As an alternative to dropping a negative reaction, you can \
make it disappear by imagining yourself becoming transpar- \
ent to the external cause of the reaction. I recommend that \
you practice it with little, even trivial, things first. Let's say \
that you are sitting quietly at home. Suddenly, there is the \
penetrating sound of a car alarm from across the street. Irri- \
tation arises. What is the purpose of the irritation? None \
whatsoever. Why did you create it? You didn't. The mind did. \
It was totally automatic, totally unconscious. Why did the \
mind create it? Because it holds the unconscious belief \
that its resistance, which you experience as negativity or \
unhappiness in some form, will somehow dissolve the unde- \
sirable condition. This, of course, is a delusion. The resis- \
tance that it creates, the irritation or anger in this case, is far \
\
\
\
192 \
\
\
\
BEYOND HAPPINESS AND UNHAPPINESS THERE IS PEACE \
\
more disturbing than the original cause that it is attempting \
to dissolve. \
\
All this can be transformed into spiritual practice. Feel \
yourself becoming transparent, as it were, without the \
solidity of a material body. Now allow the noise, or what- \
ever causes a negative reaction, to pass right through you. \
It is no longer hitting a solid "wall" inside you. As I said, \
practice with little things first. The car alarm, the dog bark- \
ing, the children screaming, the traffic jam. Instead of \
having a wall of resistance inside you that gets constantly \
and painfully hit by things that "should not be happening," \
let everything pass through you. \
\
Somebody says something to you that is rude or designed to \
hurt. Instead of going into unconscious reaction and negativ- \
ity, such as attack, defense, or withdrawal, you let it pass \
right through you. Offer no resistance. It is as if there is \
nobody there to get hurt anymore. That is forgiveness. In \
this way, you become invulnerable. You can still tell that per- \
son that his or her behavior is unacceptable, if that is what \
you choose to do. But that person no longer has the power to \
control your inner state. You are then in your power \'97 not \
in someone else's, nor are you run by your mind. Whether it \
is a car alarm, a rude person, a flood, an earthquake, or the \
loss of all your possessions, the resistance mechanism is \
the same. \
\
I have been practicing meditation, I have been to workshops, I \
have read many books on spirituality, I try to be in a state of \
nonresistance \'97 but if you ask me whether I have found true \
and lasting inner peace, my honest answer would have to be \
"no." Why haven't I found it? What else can I do? \
\
\
\
193 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
You are still seeking outside, and you cannot get out of the \
seeking mode. Maybe the next workshop will have the an- \
swer, maybe that new technique. To you I would say: Don't \
look for peace. Don't look for any other state than the one \
you are in now; otherwise, you will set up inner conflict and \
unconscious resistance. Forgive yourself for not being at \
peace. The moment you completely accept your non-peace, \
your non-peace becomes transmuted into peace. Anything \
you accept fully will get you there, will take you into peace. \
This is the miracle of surrender. \
\
\
\
You may have heard the phrase "turn the other cheek," \
which a great teacher of enlightenment used two thousand \
years ago. He was attempting to convey symbolically the \
secret of nonresistance and nonreaction. In this statement, \
as in all his others, he was concerned only with your inner \
reality, not with the outer conduct of your life. \
\
Do you know the story of Banzan? Before he became a great \
Zen master, he spent many years in the pursuit of enlighten- \
ment, but it eluded him. Then one day, as he was walking in \
the marketplace, he overheard a conversation between a \
butcher and his customer. "Give me the best piece of meat \
you have," said the customer. And the butcher replied, \
"Every piece of meat I have is the best. There is no piece of \
meat here that is not the best." Upon hearing this, Banzan \
became enlightened. \
\
\
\
194 \
\
\
\
BEYOND HAPPINESS AND UNHAPPINESS THERE IS PEACE \
\
I can see you are waiting for some explanation. When you \
accept what is, every piece of meat \'97 every moment \'97 is the \
best. That is enlightenment. \
\
THE NATURE OF COMPASSION \
\
Having gone beyond the mind-made opposites, you become \
like a deep lake. The outer situation of your life and whatever \
happens there is the surface of the lake. Sometimes calm, \
sometimes windy and rough, according to the cycles and sea- \
sons. Deep down, however, the lake is always undisturbed. \
You are the whole lake, not just the surface, and you are in \
touch with your own depth, which remains absolutely still. \
You don't resist change by mentally clinging to any situation. \
Your inner peace does not depend on it. You abide in Being \
\'97 unchanging, timeless, deathless \'97 and you are no longer \
dependent for fulfillment or happiness on the outer world of \
constantly fluctuating forms. You can enjoy them, play with \
them, create new forms, appreciate the beauty of it all. But \
there will be no need to attach yourself to any of it. \
\
When you become this detached, does it not mean that you \
also become remote from other human beings? \
\
On the contrary. As long as you are unaware of Being, the \
reality of other humans will elude you, because you have not \
found your own. Your mind will like or dislike their form, \
which is not just their body but includes their mind as well. \
True relationship becomes possible only when there is an \
awareness of Being. Coming from Being, you will perceive \
another person's body and mind as just a screen, as it were, \
\
\
\
195 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
behind which you can feel their true reality, as you feel yours. \
So, when confronted with someone else's suffering or un- \
conscious behavior, you stay present and in touch with Being \
and are thus able to look beyond the form and feel the other \
person's radiant and pure Being through your own. At the \
level of Being, all suffering is recognized as an illusion. Suf- \
fering is due to identification with form. Miracles of healing \
sometimes occur through this realization, by awakening \
Being-consciousness in others \'97 if they are ready. \
\
Is that what compassion is? \
\
Yes. Compassion is the awareness of a deep bond between \
yourself and all creatures. But there are two sides to compas- \
sion, two sides to this bond. On the one hand, since you are \
still here as a physical body, you share the vulnerability and \
mortality of your physical form with every other human \
and with every living being. Next time you say, "I have noth- \
ing in common with this person," remember that you have a \
great deal in common: A few years from now \'97 two years or \
seventy years, it doesn't make much difference \'97 both of \
you will have become rotting corpses, then piles of dust, then \
nothing at all. This is a sobering and humbling realization \
that leaves little room for pride. Is this a negative thought? \
No, it is a fact. Why close your eyes to it? In that sense, there \
is total equality between you and every other creature. \
\
One of the most powerful spiritual practices is to meditate \
deeply on the mortality of physical forms, including your \
own. This is called: Die before you die. Go into it deeply. \
Your physical form is dissolving, is no more. Then a \
moment comes when all mind-forms or thoughts also die. \
Yet you are still there \'97 the divine presence that you are. \
\
\
\
196 \
\
\
\
BEYOND HAPPINESS AND UNHAPPINESS THERE IS PEACE \
\
Radiant, fully awake. Nothing that was real ever died, only \
names, forms, and illusions. \
\
\
\
The realization of this deathless dimension, your true \
nature, is the other side of compassion. On a deep feeling- \
level, you now recognize not only your own immortality but \
through your own that of every other creature as well. On \
the level of form, you share mortality and the precarious- \
ness of existence. On the level of Being, you share eternal, \
radiant life. These are the two aspects of compassion. In \
compassion, the seemingly opposite feelings of sadness and \
joy merge into one and become transmuted into a deep \
inner peace. This is the peace of God. It is one of the most \
noble feelings that humans are capable of, and it has great \
healing and transformative power. But true compassion, as \
I have just described it, is as yet rare. To have deep empathy \
for the suffering of another being certainly requires a high \
degree of consciousness but represents only one side of \
compassion. It is not complete. True compassion goes be- \
yond empathy or sympathy. It does not happen until sad- \
ness merges with joy, the joy of Being beyond form, the joy \
of eternal life. \
\
TOWARD A DIFFERENT ORDER OF REALITY \
\
I don't agree that the body needs to die. I am convinced that \
we can achieve physical immortality. We believe in death and \
that's why the body dies. \
\
\
\
197 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
The body does not die because you believe in death. The \
body exists, or seems to, because you believe in death. Body \
and death are part of the same illusion, created by the egoic \
mode of consciousness, which has no" awareness of the \
Source of life and sees itself as separate and constantly under \
threat. So it creates the illusion that you are a body, a dense, \
physical vehicle that is constantly under threat. \
\
To perceive yourself as a vulnerable body that was born and a \
little later dies \'97 that's the illusion. Body and death: one illu- \
sion. You cannot have one without the other. You want to keep \
one side of the illusion and get rid of the other, but that is \
impossible. Either you keep all of it or you relinquish all of it. \
\
However, you cannot escape from the body, nor do you have \
to. The body is an incredible misperception of your true \
nature. But your true nature is concealed somewhere within \
that illusion, not outside it, so the body is still the only point \
of access to it. \
\
If you saw an angel but mistook it for a stone statue, all you \
would have to do is adjust your vision and look more closely \
at the "stone statue," not start looking somewhere else. You \
would then find that there never was a stone statue. \
\
If belief in death creates the body, why does an animal have a \
body? An animal doesn't have an ego, and it doesn't believe in \
death \
\
But it still dies, or seems to. \
\
Remember that your perception of the world is a reflection \
of your state of consciousness. You are not separate from it, \
and there is no objective world out there. Every moment, \
\
\
\
198 \
\
\
\
BEYOND HAPPINESS AND UNHAPPINESS THERE IS PEACE \
\
your consciousness creates the world that you inhabit. One \
of the greatest insights that has come out of modern physics \
is that of the unity between the observer and the observed: \
the person conducting the experiment \'97 the observing con- \
sciousness \'97 cannot be separated from the observed phe- \
nomena, and a different way of looking causes the observed \
phenomena to behave differently. If you believe, on a deep \
level, in separation and the struggle for survival, then you see \
that belief reflected all around you and your perceptions are \
governed by fear. You inhabit a world of death and of bodies \
fighting, killing, and devouring each other. \
\
Nothing is what it seems to be. The world that you create and \
see through the egoic mind may seem a very imperfect place, \
even a vale of tears. But whatever you perceive is only a kind \
of symbol, like an image in a dream. It is how your con- \
sciousness interprets and interacts with the molecular \
energy dance of the universe. This energy is the raw material \
of so-called physical reality. You see it in terms of bodies and \
birth and death, or as a struggle for survival. An infinite \
number of completely different interpretations, completely \
different worlds, is possible and, in fact, exists \'97 all depend- \
ing on the perceiving consciousness. Every being is a focal \
point of consciousness, and every such focal point creates its \
own world, although all those worlds are interconnected. \
There is a human world, an ant world, a dolphin world, and \
so on. There are countless beings whose consciousness fre- \
quency is so different from yours that you are probably \
unaware of their existence, as they are of yours. Highly con- \
scious beings who are aware of their connectedness with the \
Source and with each other would inhabit a world that to you \
would appear as a heavenly realm \'97 and yet all worlds are \
ultimately one. \
\
\
\
199 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
Our collective human world is largely created through the \
level of consciousness we call mind. Even within the collec- \
tive human world there are vast differences, many different \
"sub-worlds," depending on the perceivers or creators of \
their respective worlds. Since all worlds are interconnected, \
when collective human consciousness becomes trans- \
formed, nature and the animal kingdom will reflect that \
transformation. Hence the statement in the Bible that in the \
coming age "The lion shall lie down with the lamb." This \
points to the possibility of a completely different order of \
reality. \
\
The world as it appears to us now is, as I said, largely a reflec- \
tion of the egoic mind. Fear being an unavoidable conse- \
quence of egoic delusion, it is a world dominated by fear. \
Just as the images in a dream are symbols of inner states and \
feelings, so our collective reality is largely a symbolic expres- \
sion of fear and of the heavy layers of negativity that have \
accumulated in the collective human psyche. We are not \
separate from our world, so when the majority of humans \
become free of egoic delusion, this inner change will affect \
all of creation. You will literally inhabit a new world. It is a \
shift in planetary consciousness. The strange Buddhist say- \
ing that every tree and every blade of grass will eventually \
become enlightened points to the same truth. According \
to St. Paul, the whole of creation is waiting for humans to \
become enlightened. That is how I interpret his saying that \
"The created universe is waiting with eager expectation for \
God's sons to be revealed." St. Paul goes on to say that all of \
creation will become redeemed through this: "Up to the \
present . . . the whole created universe in all its parts groans \
as if in the pangs of childbirth." \

\
What is being born is a new consciousness and, as its \
inevitable reflection, a new world. This is also foretold in the \
New Testament Book of Revelation: "Then I saw a new \
heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first \
earth had passed away." \
\
But don't confuse cause and effect. Your primary task is not \
to seek salvation through creating a better world, but to \
awaken out of identification with form. You are then no \
longer bound to this world, this level of reality. You can feel \
your roots in the Unmanifested and so are free of attach- \
ment to the manifested world. You can still enjoy the pass- \
ing pleasures of this world, but there is no fear of loss \
anymore, so you don't need to cling to them. Although you \
can enjoy sensory pleasures, the craving for sensory experi- \
ence is gone, as is the constant search for fulfillment through \
psychological gratification, through feeding the ego. You are \
in touch with something infinitely greater than any pleasure, \
greater than any manifested thing. \
\
In a way, you then don't need the world anymore. You don't \
even need it to be different from the way it is. \
\
It is only at this point that you begin to make a real contribu- \
tion toward bringing about a better world, toward creating a \
different order of reality. It is only at this point that you are \
able to feel true compassion and to help others at the level of \
cause. Only those who have transcended the world can bring \
about a better world. \
\
You may remember that we talked about the dual nature of \
true compassion, which is awareness of a common bond \
of shared mortality and immortality. At this deep level, com- \
passion becomes healing in the widest sense. In that state, \
\
\
\
201 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
your healing influence is primarily based not on doing but on \
being. Everybody you come in contact with will be touched by \
your presence and affected by the peace that you emanate, \
whether they are conscious of it or not. When you are fully \
present and people around you manifest unconscious behav- \
ior, you won't feel the need to react to it, so you don't give it \
any reality. Your peace is so vast and deep that anything that \
is not peace disappears into it as if it had never existed. This \
breaks the karmic cycle of action and reaction. Animals, trees, \
flowers will feel your peace and respond to it. You teach \
through being, through demonstrating the peace of God. You \
become the "light of the world," an emanation of pure con- \
sciousness, and so you eliminate suffering on the level of \
cause. You eliminate unconsciousness from the world. \
\
\
\
This doesn't mean that you may not also teach through \
doing \'97 for example, by pointing out how to disidentify \
from the mind, recognize unconscious patterns within one- \
self, and so on. But who you are is always a more vital teach- \
ing and a more powerful transformer of the world than what \
you say, and more essential even than what you do. \
\
Furthermore, to recognize the primacy of Being, and thus \
work on the level of cause, does not exclude the possibility \
that your compassion may simultaneously manifest on the \
level of doing and of effect by alleviating suffering whenever \
you come across it. When a hungry person asks you for \
bread and you have some, you will give it. But as you give \
the bread, even though your interaction may only be very \
\
\
\
202 \
\
\
\
BEYOND HAPPINESS AND UNHAPPINESS THERE IS PEACE \
\
brief, what really matters is this moment of shared Being, of \
which the bread is only a symbol. A deep healing takes place \
within it. In that moment, there is no giver, no receiver. \
\
But there shouldn't he any hunger and starvation in the first \
place. How can we create a better world without tackling evils \
such as hunger and violence first? \
\
All evils are the effect of unconsciousness. You can alleviate \
the effects of unconsciousness, but you cannot eliminate \
them unless you eliminate their cause. True change happens \
within, not without. \
\
If you feel called upon to alleviate suffering in the world, that \
is a very noble thing to do, but remember not to focus exclu- \
sively on the outer; otherwise, you will encounter frustration \
and despair. Without a profound change in human con- \
sciousness, the world's suffering is a bottomless pit. So don't \
let your compassion become one-sided. Empathy with some- \
one else's pain or lack and a desire to help need to be bal- \
anced with a deeper realization of the eternal nature of all life \
and the ultimate illusion of all pain. Then let your peace flow \
into whatever you do and you will be working on the levels of \
effect and cause simultaneously. \
\
This also applies if you are supporting a movement designed \
to stop deeply unconscious humans from destroying them- \
selves, each other, and the planet, or from continuing to \
inflict dreadful suffering on other sentient beings. Remem- \
ber: Just as you cannot fight the darkness, so you cannot \
fight unconsciousness. If you try to do so, the polar opposites \
will become strengthened and more deeply entrenched. You \
will be-come identified with one of the polarities, you will cre- \
\

\

\
ate an "enemy," and so be drawn into unconsciousness your- \
self. Raise awareness by disseminating information, or at the \
most, practice passive resistance. But make sure that you \
carry no resistance within, no hatred, no negativity. "Love \
your enemies," said Jesus, which, of course, means "have no \
enemies." \
\
Once you get involved in working on the level of effect, it is \
all too easy to lose yourself in it. Stay alert and very, very pres- \
ent. The causal level needs to remain your primary focus, the \
teaching of enlightenment your main purpose, and peace \
your most precious gift to the world. \

CHAPTER TEN \
\
\
\
THE MEANING OF \
SURRENDER \
\
\
\
ACCEPTANCE OF THE NOW \
\
You mentioned "surrender" a few times. I don't like that idea. \
It sounds somewhat fatalistic. If we always accept the way \
things are, we are not going to make any effort to improve \
them. It seems to me what progress is all about, both in our \
personal lives and collectively, is not to accept the limitations \
of the present hut to strive to go beyond them and create some- \
thing better. If we hadn't done this, we would still be living in \
caves. How do you reconcile surrender with changing things \
and getting things done? \
\
To some people, surrender may have negative connotations, \
implying defeat, giving up, failing to rise to the challenges of \
life, becoming lethargic, and so on. True surrender, how- \
ever, is something entirely different. It does not mean to pas- \
sively put up with whatever situation you find yourself in and \
to do nothing about it. Nor does it mean to cease making \
plans or initiating positive action. \
\
Surrender is the simple but profound wisdom of yielding to \
rather than opposing the flow of life. The only place where \
\
\
\
205 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
you can experience the flow of life is the Now, so to surren- \
der is to accept the present moment unconditionally and \
without reservation. It is to relinquish inner resistance to \
what is. Inner resistance is to say "no" to what is, through \
mental judgment and emotional negativity. It becomes \
particularly pronounced when things "go wrong," which \
means that there is a gap between the demands or rigid \
expectations of your mind and what is. That is the pain gap. \
If you have lived long enough, you will know that things "go \
wrong" quite often. It is precisely at those times that surren- \
der needs to be practiced if you want to eliminate pain and sor- \
row from your life. Acceptance of what is immediately frees \
you from mind identification and thus reconnects you with \
Being. Resistance is the mind. \
\
Surrender is a purely inner phenomenon. It does not mean \
that on the outer level you cannot take action and change the \
situation. In fact, it is not the overall situation that you need \
to accept when you surrender, but just the tiny segment \
called the Now. \
\
For example, if you were stuck in the mud somewhere, you \
wouldn't say: "Okay, I resign myself to being stuck in the \
mud." Resignation is not surrender. You don't need to accept \
an undesirable or unpleasant life situation. Nor do you need \
to deceive yourself and say that there is nothing wrong with \
being stuck in the mud. No. You recognize fully that you \
want to get out of it. You then narrow your attention down \
to the present moment without mentally labeling it in any \
way. This means that there is no judgment of the Now. \
Therefore, there is no resistance, no emotional negativity. \
You accept the "isness" of this moment. Then you take \
action and do all that you can to get out of the mud. Such \
\
\
\
206 \
\
\
\
THE MEANING OF SURRENDER \
\
action I call positive action. It is far more effective than neg- \
ative action, which arises out of anger, despair, or frustra- \
tion. Until you achieve the desired result, you continue to \
practice surrender by refraining from labeling the Now. \
\
Let me give you a visual analogy to illustrate the point I am \
making. You are walking along a path at night, surrounded \
by a thick fog. But you have a powerful flashlight that cuts \
through the fog and creates a narrow, clear space in front of \
you. The fog is your life situation, which includes past and \
future; the flashlight is your conscious presence; the clear \
space is the Now. \
\
Non-surrender hardens your psychological form, the shell of \
the ego, and so creates a strong sense of separateness. The \
world around you and people in particular come to be per- \
ceived as threatening. The unconscious compulsion to de- \
stroy others through judgment arises, as does the need to \
compete and dominate. Even nature becomes your enemy \
and your perceptions and interpretations are governed by \
fear. The mental disease that we call paranoia is only a slightly \
more acute form of this normal but dysfunctional state of \
consciousness. \
\
Not only your psychological form but also your physical form \
\'97 your body \'97 becomes hard and rigid through resistance. \
Tension arises in different parts of the body, and the body as \
a whole contracts. The free flow of life energy through the \
body, which is essential for its healthy functioning, is greatly \
restricted. Bodywork and certain forms of physical therapy \
can be helpful in restoring this flow, but unless you practice \
surrender in your everyday life, those things can only give \
temporary symptom relief since the cause \'97 the resistance \
pattern \'97 has not been dissolved. \
\
\
\
207 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
There is something within you that remains unaffected by \
the transient circumstances that make up your life situation, \
and only through surrender do you have access to it. It is \
your life, your very Being \'97 which exists eternally in the \
timeless realm of the present. Finding this life is "the one \
thing that is needed" that Jesus talked about. \
\
\
\
If you find your life situation unsatisfactory or even intoler- \
able, it is only by surrendering first that you can break the \
unconscious resistance pattern that perpetuates that situation. \
\
Surrender is perfectly compatible with taking action, initiat- \
ing change, or achieving goals. But in the surrendered state \
a totally different energy, a different quality, flows into your \
doing. Surrender reconnects you with the source-energy of \
Being, and if your doing is infused with Being, it becomes a \
joyful celebration of life energy that takes you more deeply \
into the Now. Through nonresistance, the quality of your \
consciousness and, therefore, the quality of whatever you are \
doing or creating is enhanced immeasurably. The results \
will then look after themselves and reflect that quality. We \
could call this surrendered action. It is not work as we have \
known it for thousands of years. As more humans awaken, \
the word work is going to disappear from our vocabulary, \
and perhaps a new word will be created to replace it. \
\
It is the quality of your consciousness at this moment that is \
the main determinant of what kind of future you will experi- \
ence, so to surrender is the most important thing you can do \
\
\
\
208 \
\
\
\
THE MEANING OF SURRENDER \
\
to bring about positive change. Any action you take is sec- \
ondary. No truly positive action can arise out of an unsurren- \
dered state of consciousness. \
\
I can see that if I am in a situation that is unpleasant or \
unsatisfactory and I completely accept the moment as it is, \
there will be no suffering or unhappiness. I will have risen \
above it. But I still can't quite see where the energy or motiva- \
tion for taking action and bringing about change would come \
from if there isn't a certain amount of dissatisfaction. \
\
In the state of surrender, you see very clearly what needs to \
be done, and you take action, doing one thing at a time and \
focusing on one thing at a time. Learn from nature: See how \
everything gets accomplished and how the miracle of life \
unfolds without dissatisfaction or unhappiness. That's why \
Jesus said: "Look at the lilies, how they grow; they neither toil \
nor spin." \
\
If your overall situation is unsatisfactory or unpleasant, sep- \
arate out this instant and surrender to what is. That's the \
flashlight cutting through the fog. Your state of conscious- \
ness then ceases to be controlled by external conditions. You \
are no longer coming from reaction and resistance. \
\
Then look at the specifics of the situation. Ask yourself, "Is \
there anything I can do to change the situation, improve it, or \
remove myself from it?" If so, you take appropriate action. \
Focus not on the one hundred things that you will or may \
have to do at some future time but on the one thing that you \
can do now. This doesn't mean you should not do any plan- \
ning. It may well be that planning is the one thing you can do \
now. But make sure you don't start to run "mental movies," \
\
\
\
209 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
project yourself into the future, and so lose the Now. Any action \
you take may not bear fruit immediately. Until it does \'97 do not \
resist what is. If there is no action you can take, and you cannot \
remove yourself from the situation either, then use the situa- \
tion to make you go more deeply into surrender, more deeply \
into the Now, more deeply into Being. When you enter this \
timeless dimension of the present, change often comes about \
in strange ways without the need for a great deal of doing on \
your part. Life becomes helpful and cooperative. If inner factors \
such as fear, guilt, or inertia prevented you from taking action, \
they will dissolve in the light of your conscious presence. \
\
Do not confuse surrender with an attitude of "I can't be \
bothered anymore" or "I just don't care anymore." If you \
look at it closely, you will find that such an attitude is tainted \
with negativity in the form of hidden resentment and so is \
not surrender at all but masked resistance. As you surren- \
der, direct your attention inward to check if there is any \
trace of resistance left inside you. Be very alert when you do \
so; otherwise, a pocket of resistance may continue to hide in \
some dark corner in the form of a thought or an unacknowl- \
edged emotion. \
\
FROM MIND ENERGY TO SPIRITUAL ENERGY \
\
Letting go of resistance is easier said than done. I still don't see \
clearly how to let go. If you say it is by surrendering, the question \
remains: "How?" \
\
Start by acknowledging that there is resistance. Be there \
when it happens, when the resistance arises. Observe how \
your mind creates it, how it labels the situation, yourself, or \
others. Look at the thought process involved. Feel the energy \
\
\
\
210 \
\
\
\
THE MEANING OF SURRENDER \
\
of the emotion. By witnessing the resistance, you will see \
that it serves no purpose. By focusing all your attention on \
the Now, the unconscious resistance is made conscious, and \
that is the end of it. You cannot be conscious and unhappy, \
conscious and in negativity. Negativity, unhappiness, or suf- \
fering in whatever form means that there is resistance, and \
resistance is always unconscious. \
\
Surely I can be conscious of my unhappy feelings? \
\
Would you choose unhappiness? If you did not choose it, \
how did it arise? What is its purpose? Who is keeping it \
alive? You say that you are conscious of your unhappy feel- \
ings, but the truth is that you are identified with them and \
keep the process alive through compulsive thinking. All that \
is unconscious. If you were conscious, that is to say totally \
present in the Now, all negativity would dissolve almost \
instantly. It could not survive in your presence. It can only \
survive in your absence. Even the pain-body cannot survive \
for long in your presence. You keep your unhappiness alive \
by giving it time. That is its lifeblood. Remove time through \
intense present-moment awareness and it dies. But do you \
want it to die? Have you truly had enough? Who would you be \
without it? \
\
Until you practice surrender, the spiritual dimension is \
something you read about, talk about, get excited about, write \
books about, think about, believe in \'97 or don't, as the case \
may be. It makes no difference. Not until you surrender does \
it become a living reality in your life. When you do, the energy \
that you emanate and which then runs your life is of a much \
higher vibrational frequency than the mind energy that still \
runs our world \'97 the energy that created the existing social, \
\
\
\
211 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
political, and economic structures of our civilization, and \
which also continuously perpetuates itself through our edu- \
cational systems and the media. Through surrender, spiri- \
tual energy comes into this world. It creates no suffering for \
yourself, for other humans, or any other life form on the \
planet. Unlike mind energy, it does not pollute the earth, and \
it is not subject to the law of polarities, which dictates that \
nothing can exist without its opposite, that there can be no \
good without bad. Those who run on mind energy, which \
is still the vast majority of the Earth's population, remain \
unaware of the existence of spiritual energy. It belongs to a \
different order of reality and will create a different world \
when a sufficient number of humans enter the surrendered \
state and so become totally free of negativity. If the Earth is to \
survive, this will be the energy of those who inhabit it. \
\
Jesus referred to this energy when he made his famous \
prophetic statement in the Sermon on the Mount: "Blessed \
are the gentle; they shall have the earth for their possession." \
It is a silent but intense presence that dissolves the uncon- \
scious patterns of the mind. They may still remain active for \
a while, but they won't run your life anymore. The external \
conditions that were being resisted also tend to shift or dis- \
solve quickly through surrender. It is a powerful transformer \
of situations and people. If conditions do not shift immedi- \
ately, your acceptance of the Now enables you to rise above \
them. Either way, you are free. \
\
SURRENDER IN PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS \
\
What about people who want to use me, manipulate or con- \
trol me? Am I to surrender to them? \
\
\
\
212 \
\
\
\
THE MEANING OF SURRENDER \
\
They are cut off from Being, so they unconsciously attempt \
to get energy and power from you. It is true that only an \
unconscious person will try to use or manipulate others, but \
it is equally true that only an unconscious person can be \
used and manipulated. If you resist or fight unconscious \
behavior in others, you become unconscious yourself. But \
surrender doesn't mean that you allow yourself to be used by \
unconscious people. Not at all. It is perfectly possible to say \
"no" firmly and clearly to a person or to walk away from a sit- \
uation and be in a state of complete inner nonresistance at \
the same time. When you say "no" to a person or a situation, \
let it come not from reaction but from insight, from a clear \
realization of what is right or not right for you at that \
moment. Let it be a nonreactive "no," a high-quality "no," a \
"no" that is free of all negativity and so creates no further suf- \
fering. \
\
J am in a situation at work that is unpleasant. I have tried to \
surrender to it, but I find it impossible. A lot of resistance \
keeps coming up. \
\
If you cannot surrender, take action immediately: Speak up \
or do something to bring about a change in the situation \'97 or \
remove yourself from it. Take responsibility for your life. Do \
not pollute your beautiful, radiant inner Being nor the Earth \
with negativity. Do not give unhappiness in any form what- \
soever a dwelling place inside you. \
\
If you cannot take action, for example if you are in prison, \
then you have two choices left: resistance or surrender. \
Bondage or inner freedom from external conditions. Suffer- \
ing or inner peace. \
\
\
\
213 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
Is nonresistance also to be practiced in the external conduct of \
our lives, such as nonresistance to violence, or is it something \
that just concerns our inner life? \
\
You only need to be concerned with the inner aspect. That is \
primary. Of course, that will also transform the conduct of \
your outer life, your relationships, and so on. \
\
Your relationships will be changed profoundly by surrender. \
If you can never accept what is, by implication you will not be \
able to accept anybody the way they are. You will judge, criti- \
cize, label, reject, or attempt to change people. Furthermore, \
if you continuously make the Now into a means to an end in \
the future, you will also make every person you encounter or \
relate with into a means to an end. The relationship \'97 the \
human being \'97 is then of secondary importance to you, or of \
no importance at all. What you can get out of the relationship \
is primary \'97 be it material gain, a sense of power, physical \
pleasure, or some form of ego gratification. \
\
Let me illustrate how surrender can work in relationships. \
When you become involved in an argument or some conflict \
situation, perhaps with a partner or someone close to you, \
start by observing how defensive you become as your own \
position is attacked, or feel the force of your own aggression \
as you attack the other person's position. Observe the attach- \
ment to your views and opinions. Feel the mental-emotional \
energy behind your need to be right and make the other per- \
son wrong. That's the energy of the egoic mind. You make it \
conscious by acknowledging it, by feeling it as fully as pos- \
sible. Then one day, in the middle of an argument, you will \
suddenly realize that you have a choice, and you may decide \
to drop your own reaction \'97 just to see what happens. You \
\
\
\
214 \
\
\
\
THE MEANING OF SURRENDER \
\
\
\
surrender. I don't mean dropping the reaction just verbally \
by saying, "Okay, you are right," with a look on your face that \
says, "I am above all this childish unconsciousness." That's \
just displacing the resistance to another level, with the egoic \
mind still in charge, claiming superiority. I am speaking of \
letting go of the entire mental-emotional energy field inside \
you that was fighting for power. \
\
The ego is cunning, so you have to be very alert, very present, \
and totally honest with yourself to see whether you have truly \
relinquished your identification with a mental position and so \
freed yourself from your mind. If you suddenly feel very light, \
clear, and deeply at peace, that is an unmistakable sign that \
you have truly surrendered. Then observe what happens to \
the other person's mental position as you no longer energize \
it through resistance. When identification with mental posi- \
tions is out of the way, true communication begins. \
\
What about nonresistance in the face of violence, aggression, \
and the like? \
\
Nonresistance doesn't necessarily mean doing nothing. All it \
means is that any "doing" becomes nonreactive. Remember \
the deep wisdom underlying the practice of Eastern martial \
arts: Don't resist the opponent's force. Yield to overcome. \
\
Having said that, "doing nothing" when you are in a state of \
intense presence is a very powerful transformer and healer \
of situations and people. In Taoism, there is a term called wu \
wei, which is usually translated as "actionless activity" or "sit- \
ting quietly doing nothing." In ancient China, this was \
regarded as one of the highest achievements or virtues. It \
is radically different from inactivity in the ordinary state of \
\
\
\
215 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
consciousness, or rather unconsciousness, which stems from \
fear, inertia, or indecision. The real "doing nothing" implies \
inner nonresistance and intense alertness. \
\
On the other hand, if action is required, you will no longer \
react from your conditioned mind, but you will respond to \
the situation out of your conscious presence. In that state, \
your mind is free of concepts, including the concept of non- \
violence. So who can predict what you will do? \
\
The ego believes that in your resistance lies your strength, \
whereas in truth resistance cuts you off from Being, the only \
place of true power. Resistance is weakness and fear mas- \
querading as strength. What the ego sees as weakness is \
your Being in its purity, innocence, and power. What it sees \
as strength is weakness. So the ego exists in a continuous \
resistance-mode and plays counterfeit roles to cover up your \
"weakness," which in truth is your power. \
\
Until there is surrender, unconscious role-playing consti- \
tutes a large part of human interaction. In surrender, you no \
longer need ego defenses and false masks. You become very \
simple, very real. "That's dangerous," says the ego. "You'll \
get hurt. You'll become vulnerable." What the ego doesn't \
know, of course, is that only through the letting go of resist- \
ance, through becoming "vulnerable," can you discover your \
true and essential invulnerability. \
\
TRANSFORMING ILLNESS INTO ENLIGHTENMENT \
\
If someone is seriously ill and completely accepts their condi- \
tion and surrenders to the illness, would they not have given \
up their will to get back to health? The determination to fight \
the illness would not he there anymore, would it? \
\
\
\
216 \
\
\
\
THE MEANING OF SURRENDER \
\
Surrender is inner acceptance of what is without any reser- \
vations. We are talking about your life \'97 this instant \'97 not \
the conditions or circumstances of your life, not what I call \
your life situation. We have spoken about this already. \
\
With regard to illness, this is what it means. Illness is part of \
your life situation. As such, it has a past and a future. Past \
and future form an uninterrupted continuum, unless the \
redeeming power of the Now is activated through your \
conscious presence. As you know, underneath the various \
conditions that make up your life situation, which exists in \
time, there is something deeper, more essential: your Life, \
your very Being in the timeless Now. \
\
As there are no problems in the Now, there is no illness \
either. The belief in a label that someone attaches to your con- \
dition keeps the condition in place, empowers it, and makes \
a seemingly solid reality out of a temporary imbalance. It \
gives it not only reality and solidity but also a continuity in \
time that it did not have before. By focusing on this instant \
and refraining from labeling it mentally, illness is reduced to \
one or several of these factors: physical pain, weakness, dis- \
comfort, or disability. That is what you surrender to \'97 now. \
You do not surrender to the idea of "illness." Allow the suffer- \
ing to force you into the present moment, into a state of \
intense conscious presence. Use it for enlightenment. \
\
Surrender does not transform what is, at least not directly. Sur- \
render transforms you. When you are transformed, your \
whole world is transformed, because the world is only a \
reflection. We spoke about this earlier. \
\
If you looked in the mirror and did not like what you saw, you \
would have to be mad to attack the image in the mirror. That \
\
\
\
217 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
is precisely what you do when you are in a state of nonaccep- \
tance. And, of course, if you attack the image, it attacks you \
back. If you accept the image, no matter what it is, if you be- \
come friendly toward it, it cannot not become friendly toward \
you. This is how you change the world. \
\
Illness is not the problem. You are the problem \'97 as long as \
the egoic mind is in control. When you are ill or disabled, do \
not feel that you have failed in some way, do not feel guilty. \
Do not blame life for treating you unfairly, but do not blame \
yourself either. All that is resistance. If you have a major ill- \
ness, use it for enlightenment. Anything "bad" that happens \
in your life \'97 use it for enlightenment. Withdraw time from \
the illness. Do not give it any past or future. Let it force you \
into intense present-moment awareness \'97 and see what \
happens. \
\
Become an alchemist. Transmute base metal into gold, suf- \
fering into consciousness, disaster into enlightenment. \
\
Are you seriously ill and feeling angry now about what I have \
just said? Then that is a clear sign that the illness has \
become part of your sense of self and that you are now pro- \
tecting your identity \'97 as well as protecting the illness. The \
condition that is labeled "illness" has nothing to do with who \
you truly are. \
\
WHEN DISASTER STRIKES \
\
As far as the still unconscious majority of the population is \
concerned, only a critical limit-situation has the potential \
to crack the hard shell of the ego and force them into surren- \
der and so into the awakened state. A limit-situation arises \
when through some disaster, drastic upheaval, deep loss, or \
\
\
\
218 \
\
\
\
THE MEANING OF SURRENDER \
\
suffering your whole world is shattered and doesn't make \
sense anymore. It is an encounter with death, be it physical \
or psychological. The egoic mind, the creator of this world, \
collapses. Out of the ashes of the old world, a new world can \
then come into being. \
\
There is no guarantee, of course, that even a limit-situation \
will do it, but the potential is always there. Some people's \
resistance to what is even intensifies in such a situation, \
and so it becomes a descent into hell. In others, there may \
only be partial surrender, but even that will give them a \
certain depth and serenity that were not there before. Parts \
of the ego shell break off, and this allows small amounts of \
the radiance and peace that lie beyond the mind to shine \
through. \
\
Limit-situations have produced many miracles. There have \
been murderers on death row waiting for execution who, in \
the last few hours of their lives, experienced the egoless state \
and the deep joy and peace that come with it. The inner \
resistance to the situation they found themselves in became \
so intense as to produce unbearable suffering, and there was \
nowhere to run and nothing to do to escape it, not even a \
mind-projected future. So they were forced into complete \
acceptance of the unacceptable. They were forced into sur- \
render. In this way, they were able to enter the state of grace \
with which comes redemption: complete release from the \
past. Of course, it is not really the limit-situation that makes \
room for the miracle of grace and redemption, but the act of \
surrender. \
\
So whenever any kind of disaster strikes, or something \
goes seriously "wrong" \'97 illness, disability, loss of home or \
fortune or of a socially defined identity, breakup of a close \
\
\
\
219 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
relationship, death or suffering of a loved one, or your own \
impending death \'97 know that there is another side to it, that \
you are just one step away from something incredible: a com- \
plete alchemical transmutation of the base metal of pain and \
suffering into gold. That one step is called surrender. \
\
I do not mean to say that you will become happy in such a sit- \
uation. You will not. But fear and pain will become trans- \
muted into an inner peace and serenity that come from a very \
deep place \'97 from the Unmanifested itself. It is "the peace of \
God, which passes all understanding." Compared to that, hap- \
piness is quite a shallow thing. With this radiant peace comes \
the realization \'97 not on the level of mind but within the depth \
of your Being \'97 that you are indestructible, immortal. This is \
not a belief. It is absolute certainty that needs no external evi- \
dence or proof from some secondary source. \
\
TRANSFORMING SUFFERING INTO PEACE \
\
I read about a stoic philosopher in ancient Greece who, when \
he was told that his son had died in an accident, replied, "I \
knew he was not immortal." Is that surrender? If it is, I don't \
want it. There are some situations in which surrender seems \
unnatural and inhuman. \
\
Being cut off from your feelings is not surrender. But we \
don't know what his inner state was when he said those \
words. In certain extreme situations, it may still be impos- \
sible for you to accept the Now. But you always get a second \
chance at surrender. \
\
Your first chance is to surrender each moment to the reality \
of that moment. Knowing that what is cannot be undone \'97 \
\
\
\
220 \
\
\
\
THE MEANING OF SURRENDER \
\
because it already is \'97 you say yes to what is or accept what \
isn't. Then you do what you have to do, whatever the situa- \
tion requires. If you abide in this state of acceptance, you \
create no more negativity, no more suffering, no more \
unhappiness. You then live in a state of nonresistance, a \
state of grace and lightness, free of struggle. \
\
Whenever you are unable to do that, whenever you miss that \
chance \'97 either because you are not generating enough con- \
scious presence to prevent some habitual and unconscious \
resistance pattern from arising or because the condition is so \
extreme as to be absolutely unacceptable to you \'97 then you \
are creating some form of pain, some form of suffering. It \
may look as if the situation is creating the suffering, but ulti- \
mately this is not so \'97 your resistance is. \
\
Now here is your second chance at surrender: If you cannot \
accept what is outside, then accept what is inside. If you can- \
not accept the external condition, accept the internal condi- \
tion. This means: Do not resist the pain. Allow it to be there. \
Surrender to the grief, despair, fear, loneliness, or whatever \
form the suffering takes. Witness it without labeling it men- \
tally. Embrace it. Then see how the miracle of surrender \
transmutes deep suffering into deep peace. This is your \
crucifixion. Let it become your resurrection and ascension. \
\
I do not see how one can surrender to suffering. As you your- \
self pointed out, suffering is non-surrender. How could you \
surrender to non-surrender? \
\
Forget about surrender for a moment. When your pain is \
deep, all talk of surrender will probably seem futile and \
meaningless anyway. When your pain is deep, you will likely \
\
\
\
221 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
have a strong urge to escape from it rather than surrender to \
it. You don't want to feel what you feel. What could be more \
normal? But there is no escape, no way out. There are many \
pseudo escapes \'97 work, drink, drugs, anger, projection, \
suppression, and so on \'97 but they don't free you from the \
pain. Suffering does not diminish in intensity when you \
make it unconscious. When you deny emotional pain, every- \
thing you do or think as well as your relationships become \
contaminated with it. You broadcast it, so to speak, as the \
energy you emanate, and others will pick it up subliminally. \
If they are unconscious, they may even feel compelled to \
attack or hurt you in some way, or you may hurt them in an \
unconscious projection of your pain. You attract and mani- \
fest whatever corresponds to your inner state. \
\
When there is no way out, there is still always a way through. \
So don't turn away from the pain. Face it. Feel it fully. Feel it \
\'97 don't think about it! Express it if necessary, but don't cre- \
ate a script in your mind around it. Give all your attention to \
the feeling, not to the person, event, or situation that seems to \
have caused it. Don't let the mind use the pain to create a vic- \
tim identity for yourself out of it. Feeling sorry for yourself \
and telling others your story will keep you stuck in suffering. \
Since it is impossible to get away from the feeling, the only \
possibility of change is to move into it; otherwise, nothing will \
shift. So give your complete attention to what you feel, and \
refrain from mentally labeling it. As you go into the feeling, \
be intensely alert. At first, it may seem like a dark and terrify- \
ing place, and when the urge to turn away from it comes, \
observe it but don't act on it. Keep putting your attention on \
the pain, keep feeling the grief, the fear, the dread, the loneli- \
ness, whatever it is. Stay alert, stay present \'97 present with \
your whole Being, with every cell of your body. As you do so, \
\
\
\
222 \
\
\
\
THE MEANING OF SURRENDER \
\
you are bringing a light into this darkness. This is the flame \
of your consciousness. \
\
At this stage, you don't need to be concerned with surrender \
anymore. It has happened already. How? Full attention is full \
acceptance, is surrender. By giving full attention, you use the \
power of the Now, which is the power of your presence. No \
hidden pocket of resistance can survive in it. Presence \
removes time. Without time, no suffering, no negativity, can \
survive. \
\
The acceptance of suffering is a journey into death. Facing \
deep pain, allowing it to be, taking your attention into it, is to \
enter death consciously. When you have died this death, you \
realize that there is no death \'97 and there is nothing to fear. \
Only the ego dies. Imagine a ray of sunlight that has forgot- \
ten it is an inseparable part of the sun and deludes itself into \
believing it has to fight for survival and create and cling to an \
identity other than the sun. Would the death of this delusion \
not be incredibly liberating? \
\
Do you want an easy death? Would you rather die without \
pain, without agony? Then die to the past every moment, and \
let the light of your presence shine away the heavy, time- \
bound self you thought of as "you." \
\
\
\
THE WAY OF THE CROSS \
\
There are many accounts of people who say they have found \
God through their deep suffering, and there is the Christian \
\
\
\
223 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
\
\
expression "the way of the cross, " which I suppose points to the \
same thing. \
\
We are concerned with nothing else here. \
\
Strictly speaking, they did not find God through their suffer- \
ing, because suffering implies resistance. They found God \
through surrender, through total acceptance of what is, into \
which they were forced by their intense suffering. They must \
have realized on some level that their pain was self-created. \
\
How do you equate surrender with finding God? \
\
Since resistance is inseparable from the mind, relinquish- \
ment of resistance \'97 surrender \'97 is the end of the mind \
as your master, the impostor pretending to be "you," the \
false god. All judgment and all negativity dissolve. The \
realm of Being, which had been obscured by the mind, then \
opens up. Suddenly, a great stillness arises within you, an \
unfathomable sense of peace. And within that peace, there \
is great joy. And within that joy, there is love. And at the \
innermost core, there is the sacred, the immeasurable, That \
which cannot be named. \
\
I don't call it finding God, because how can you find that \
which was never lost, the very life that you are? The word God \
is limiting not only because of thousands of years of mis- \
perception and misuse, but also because it implies an entity \
other than you. God is Being itself, not a being. There can be \
no subject-object relationship here, no duality, no you and \
God. God-realization is the most natural thing there is. The \
amazing and incomprehensible fact is not that you can be- \
come conscious of God but that you are not conscious of God. \
\
\
\
224 \
\
\
\
THE MEANING OF SURRENDER \
\
The way of the cross that you mentioned is the old way to \
enlightenment, and until recently it was the only way. But \
don't dismiss it or underestimate its efficacy. It still works. \
\
The way of the cross is a complete reversal. It means that the \
worst thing in your life, your cross, turns into the best thing \
that ever happened to you, by forcing you into surrender, \
into "death," forcing you to become as nothing, to become as \
God \'97 because God, too, is no-thing. \
\
At this time, as far as the unconscious majority of humans is \
concerned, the way of the cross is still the only way. They will \
only awaken through further suffering, and enlightenment \
as a collective phenomenon will be predictably preceded by \
vast upheavals. This process reflects the workings of certain \
universal laws that govern the growth of consciousness and \
thus was foreseen by some seers. It is described, among \
other places, in the Book of Revelation or Apocalypse, though \
cloaked in obscure and sometimes impenetrable symbology. \
This suffering is inflicted not by God but by humans on \
themselves and on each other, as well as by certain defensive \
measures that the Earth, which is a living, intelligent organ- \
ism, is going to take to protect herself from the onslaught of \
human madness. \
\
However, there is a growing number of humans alive today \
whose consciousness is sufficiently evolved not to need any \
more suffering before the realization of enlightenment. You \
may be one of them. \
\
Enlightenment through suffering \'97 the way of the cross \'97 \
means to be forced into the kingdom of heaven kicking and \
screaming. You finally surrender because you can't stand the \
pain anymore, but the pain could go on for a long time until \
\
\
\
225 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
this happens. Enlightenment consciously chosen means to \
relinquish your attachment to past and future and to make \
the Now the main focus of your life. It means choosing to \
dwell in the state of presence rather than in time. It means \
saying yes to what is. You then don't need pain anymore. \
How much more time do you think you will need before you \
are able to say, "I will create no more pain, no more suffer- \
ing"? How much more pain do you need before you can \
make that choice? \
\
If you think that you need more time, you will get more time \
\'97 and more pain. Time and pain are inseparable. \
\
THE POWER TO CHOOSE \
\
What about all those people who, it seems, actually want to \
suffer? I have a friend whose partner is physically abusive \
toward her, and her previous relationship was of a similar \
kind. Why does she choose such men, and why is she refusing \
to get out of that situation now? Why do so many people actu- \
ally choose pain? \
\
I know that the word choose is a favorite New Age term, but \
it isn't entirely accurate in this context. It is misleading to say \
that somebody "chose" a dysfunctional relationship or any \
other negative situation in his or her life. Choice implies \
consciousness \'97 a high degree of consciousness. Without it, \
you have no choice. Choice begins the moment you disiden- \
tify from the mind and its conditioned patterns, the moment \
you become present. Until you reach that point, you are un- \
conscious, spiritually speaking. This means that you are com- \
pelled to think, feel, and act in certain ways according to the \
conditioning of your mind. That is why Jesus said: "Forgive \
\
\
\
226 \
\
\
\
THE MEANING OF SURRENDER \
\
them, for they know not what they do." This is not related to \
intelligence in the conventional sense of the word. I have \
met many highly intelligent and educated people who were \
also completely unconscious, which is to say completely \
identified with their mind. In fact, if mental development \
and increased knowledge are not counterbalanced by a corre- \
sponding growth in consciousness, the potential for unhap- \
piness and disaster is very great. \
\
Your friend is stuck in a relationship with an abusive partner, \
and not for the first time. Why? No choice. The mind, condi- \
tioned as it is by the past, always seeks to re-create what it \
knows and is familiar with. Even if it is painful, at least it is \
familiar. The mind always adheres to the known. The \
unknown is dangerous because it has no control over it. \
That's why the mind dislikes and ignores the present \
moment. Present-moment awareness creates a gap not only \
in the stream of mind but also in the past-future continuum. \
Nothing truly new and creative can come into this world \
except through that gap, that clear space of infinite possibility. \
\
So your friend, being identified with her mind, may be re- \
creating a pattern learned in the past in which intimacy and \
abuse are inseparably linked. Alternatively, she may be acting \
out a mind pattern learned in early childhood according to \
which she is unworthy and deserves to be punished. It is pos- \
sible, too, that she lives a large part of her life through the \
pain-body, which always seeks more pain on which to feed. \
Her partner has his own unconscious patterns, which com- \
plement hers. Of course her situation is self-created, but \
who or what is the self that is doing the creating? A mental- \
emotional pattern from the past, no more. Why make a self \
out of it? If you tell her that she has chosen her condition or \
\
\
\
227 \
\
\
\
THE POWER OF NOW \
\
situation, you are reinforcing her state of mind identification. \
But is her mind pattern who she is? Is it her self? Is her true \
identity derived from the past? Show your friend how to be \
the observing presence behind her thoughts and her emo- \
tions. Tell her about the pain-body and how to free herself \
from it. Teach her the art of inner-body awareness. Demon- \
strate to her the meaning of presence. As soon as she is able \
to access the power of the Now, and thereby break through \
her conditioned past, she will have a choice. \
\
Nobody chooses dysfunction, conflict, pain. Nobody chooses \
insanity. They happen because there is not enough presence \
in you to dissolve the past, not enough light to dispel the \
darkness. You are not fully here. You have not quite woken \
up yet. In the meantime, the conditioned mind is running \
your life. \
\
Similarly, if you are one of the many people who have an \
issue with their parents, if you still harbor resentment about \
something they did or did not do, then you still believe that \
they had a choice \'97 that they could have acted differently. It \
always looks as if people had a choice, but that is an illusion. \
As long as your mind with its conditioned patterns runs your \
life, as long as you are your mind, what choice do you have? \
None. You are not even there. The mind-identified state is \
severely dysfunctional. It is a form of insanity. Almost every- \
one is suffering from this illness in varying degrees. The \
moment you realize this, there can be no more resentment. \
How can you resent someone's illness? The only appropriate \
response is compassion. \
\
So that means nobody is responsible for what they do? I don't \
like that idea. \
\
\
\
228 \
\
\
\
THE MEANING OF SURRENDER \
\
If you are run by your mind, although you have no choice \
you will still suffer the consequences of your unconscious- \
ness, and you will create further suffering. You will bear the \
burden of fear, conflict, problems, and pain. The suffering \
thus created will eventually force you out of your uncon- \
scious state. \
\
What you say about choice also applies to forgiveness, I sup- \
pose. You need to be fully conscious and surrender before you \
can forgive. \
\
"Forgiveness" is a term that has been in use for two thou- \
sand years, but most people have a very limited view of what \
it means. You cannot truly forgive yourself or others as long \
as you derive your sense of self from the past. Only through \
accessing the power of the Now, which is your own power, \
can there be true forgiveness. This renders the past power- \
less, and you realize deeply that nothing you ever did or that \
was ever done to you could touch even in the slightest the \
radiant essence of who you are. The whole concept of for- \
giveness then becomes unnecessary. \
\
And how do I get to that point of realization? \
\
When you surrender to what is and so become fully present, \
the past ceases to have any power. You do not need it any- \
more. Presence is the key. The Now is the key. \
\
How will I know when I have surrendered? \
\
When you no longer need to ask the question. \

ABOUT THE AUTHOR \
\
\
\
Eckhart Tolle was born in Germany, where he spent the first \
thirteen years of his life. After graduating from the University \
of London, he was a research scholar and supervisor at \
Cambridge University. When he was twenty-nine, a profound \
spiritual transformation virtually dissolved his old identity and \
radically changed the course of his life. \
\
He devoted the next few years to understanding, integrating, \
and deepening that transformation, which marked the begin- \
ning of an intense inward journey. Eckhart is not aligned with \
any particular religion or tradition. In his teaching, he conveys a \
simple yet profound message with the timeless and uncompli- \
cated clarity of the ancient spiritual masters: there is a way out of \
suffering and into peace. \
\
Eckhart is currently traveling extensively, taking his teachings and \
his presence throughout the world. He has lived in Vancouver, \
Canada, since 1996. }
